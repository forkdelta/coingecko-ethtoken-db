  Inverse Index of: sDEFI


  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse DeFi Index (DEFI) through price feeds supplied by an oracle. The
  entry point is $2757 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when it
  reaches its upper limit of $4135.5 (i.e. when Inverse DeFi Index's value reaches $1378.5) or its lower
  limit of $1378.5 (i.e. when Inverse DeFi Indexâ€™s value reaches $4135.5). If it reaches either of its
  limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still
  be traded for other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits,
  it will be substituted for another iDEFI with different limits.
