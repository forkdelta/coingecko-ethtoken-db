  Menlo One is a crypto-tech company that has built an open-source framework for making decentralized
  applications easier and faster to use in the Web 3.0 era. Menlo One decentralized database and Proof-of-Reputation
  incentive system is the infrastructure that enables the Web 3.0 generation of marketplaces, social media
  platforms, and future apps to be as fast and performant as their centralized predecessors.


  Built on the Ethereum network, Menlo Oneâ€™s technology offers communication, social, and automation capabilities
  that were previously unavailable. Together, these improvements address the critical limitations around
  user experience, security, and compliance that presently stymie widespread adoption.


  Menlo One framework is being used to develop the only token sale marketplace with security, messaging
  & governance for making the Token Economy mainstream.
