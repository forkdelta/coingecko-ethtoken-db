  The Aggregator is a decentralised exchange (DEX) platform created to serve as an interconnected liquidity
  gateway that functions through aggregation protocols created within the delegated broker-staking mechanism
  (proof of broker). Our protocol functions through liquidity provided on swap pools, all major crypto
  currency exchange platforms (decentralized and centralized), giving the user the best aggregation tool
  that opens up possibilities to better decisions on liquidity swaps, arbitrage finance, liquidity pools
  and farming.
