They decide which tasks need to be completed and how many of their tokens to award users. The system calculates the amount of company tokens required for the campaign and tokens are automatically added to the user\u2019s wallet when the campaign is complete.\n\nIn addition to company tokens, users are also awarded CoinClaim (CLM) tokens for completing tasks such as logging in daily and weekly, completing company CoinClaims, birthdays, holidays and more. CLM tokens are also available to non-crypto companies who want to promote their brands to the crypto community through CoinClaim.
