This Set automatically allocates cash (DAI) into BTC if the price of BTC dips more than 40% and BTC into cash (DAI) if the price of BTC rebounds more than 30%. The token tolerances are selected to balance profit against risk, preventing token holders from selling into a rally (or buying into a drop) yet still taking profits when the downside of missing a trade is too high.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"btc-range-bound-high-volatility-set","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10599/large/btc_buy_the_dip.png?1580964644","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10599/small/btc_buy_the_dip.png?1580964644","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10599/thumb/btc_buy_the_dip.png?1580964644"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/set-protocol"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x6123A0CBC95Cb157995A0795187A60995B85e0A9"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/x3PGVfP"],"homepage":["https://www.tokensets.com/set/btchivol"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/SetProtocol/set-protocol-contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"SetProtocol"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"BTC Range Bound High Volatility Set","public_interest_score":0.016,"symbol":"btchivol","tickers":[]}
