  Our purpose is to build a comprehensive protocol matrix for open finance and value transfer protocol
  applications developed based on

  blockchain technology. The combination of digital assets and blockchain cutting-edge technology is expected
  to change the monopoly

  pattern of classical finance. As we all know, the operation of traditional finance is subject to the
  management of the administrative

  system, and these artificially divided worlds have also greatly prevented the effective circulation
  of value. The way of operation we

  believe in is to abandon the present and take a glance at the current world, the current high-cost,
  centralized, powerful and centralized

  financial world, her presentation includes but is not limited to financial activities such as credit
  creation, debit and credit, payment,

  securities underwriting, IPO, etc, which all must be executed by a trusted centralized third-party organization.

  While in centralized finance, trust comes from authority and the authorization of centralized agencies.
  As the authority, the

  administrative agency controls the pricing power of assets. However, in different administrative regions,
  the circulation of value is

  more dependent on the relationship among regions. In terms of specific presentation, individuals must
  rely on their own labor to obtain

  equivalents recognized by the administrative agencies, i.e, assets, and these assets will change in
  value with the fluctuation of the

  administrative agency. From the perspective of liquidity, the circulation of assets must rely on the
  traditional financial channel, which

  lead to huge losses in it.

  Since the creation of Bitcoin, the greatest achievement of digital currency or blockchain is the realization
  of value transmission on the

  network under the premise of minimizing trust. It eliminates the bottleneck of capital flow and allows
  currency and value to return to

  their origins——i.e value is information, and the instantaneous flow without friction can be achieved
  through Bit (the smallest unit of

  information).

  The combination of the unlicensed and trust-free features of digital currency and blockchain technology,
  which gives it the opportunity

  to reshape the current financial and monetary system.

  The birth of Ethereum has greatly expanded the capabilities of Bitcoin as a currency and settlement
  network. For the first time, we

  have witnessed the rise of an expanding and self-improving financial protocol network.The Ethereum network
  has become a hotbed

  that nurtures a new financial and monetary system with strong vitality. We can carry out activities
  such as token sale, stable currency,

  decentralized trading, currency market, lending market, insurance, forecasting, games, etc. within a
  global range without permission,

  trust-free, and non-friction, thus starting the new historical chapter for open finance.

  In an open financial system, users always have control over their assets and do not need to rely on
  counter-parties (such as custodians

  or national sovereignty) to make financial decisions. The open financial system will promote faster
  and better innovation and iteration

  of financial protocols in order to provide better products and services to billions of people around
  the world.
