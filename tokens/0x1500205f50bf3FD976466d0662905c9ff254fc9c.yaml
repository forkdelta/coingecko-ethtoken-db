description: >-
  The Block is a fully decentralised e-commerce marketplace, designed for privacy and low fees. It takes
  the form of a standalone app based on Ethereum’s smart contracts and uses the ETH currency for all payments
  except merchant listings. As a global application with minimal technical requirements for users, this
  is free trade at its most free. BitBoost’s aim is to facilitate truly free trade on a global scale.
  Building on the work of almost three years, The Block is their solution: a totally peer-to-peer e-commerce
  experience, without unnecessary costs, geographical limitations or arbitrary restrictions.
