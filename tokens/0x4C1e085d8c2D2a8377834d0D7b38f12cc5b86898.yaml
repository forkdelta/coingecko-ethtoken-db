  The SilkChain ecosystem is essentially a blockchain technology that attempts to solve various pain points
  in the industry and build a “global blockchain free trading zone”. At the same time, it provides free
  SAAS e-commerce services to global traditional exchange. Based on Token's economic transformation, it
  breaks down localized data islands, establishes a big business-based credit system, and promotes trade
  circulation, payment, and finance. In the free trade zone, the silk chain provides the underlying blockchain
  infrastructure and introduces a pass-through system as a measure of the value of trade activity between
  merchants. In various application scenarios, the Silk Chain will work with many third-party service
  organizations around the world to customize smart contracts for various business processes according
  to localized trade rules and management regulations, and collaboratively develop new DApps based on
  existing business models.
