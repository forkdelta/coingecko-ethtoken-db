description: >-
  A5T is the native exchange token of Alpha5.io. 60% of the A5T supply will be issued through Taker-Driven
  Mining (Emissions) process. Ultimately A5T tokens will transition to ‘governance tokens’ for the Alpha5
  exchange. Naturally the most 'active participants' on Alpha5 will want to have a REAL SAY in how the
  exchange operates (example: potentially shifting from a fees-per-trade model to a Membership Model).
