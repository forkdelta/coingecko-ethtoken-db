description: >-
  Island Coin is a community-based, deflationary coin built on custom code with community redistributions
  and recurring burn events. When you join the island coin community, youâ€™re adopting a lifestyle. $ISLE
  has a host of new features that will enable it to weather current market corrections and deliver significant
  growth.


  First and foremost is SAND, a community-first redistribution mechanism that awards holders. SAND captures
  and pools together 5% of every $ISLE transaction. Whenever the pool reaches a predetermined amount,
  the SAND redistributes to all holders with over 100M $ISLE with one wallet earning 25% of the pool,
  50% going to 100 wallets and the rest of eligible wallets splitting 25%. In true island fashion, we
  also burn 5% of tokens. Instead of automatically burning, we will burn in weekly intervals on Friday.
