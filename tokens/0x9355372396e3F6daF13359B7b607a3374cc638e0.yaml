description: >-
  $WHALE is a social currency (cryptocurrency) that is backed by tangible and rare Non-Fungible Token
  (NFT) assets, while embodying scarcity through definitive limited issuance. $WHALE aims to be a tangible
  asset backed currency, with one dimension of the token value ascribed to it's "VAULT" contents of digital
  art and collectibles. The full value proposition WHALE is descibed by the team as encompassing: 1. The
  Vault; 2. The Brand; 3. The Community; 4. Leadership; and 5. Tokenomics. Noteably, the token is currently
  transitioning to a DAO structure, whereby the community will have full control of the $WHALE assets
  and revenue generation streams.
