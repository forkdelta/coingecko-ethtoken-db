  AurusGOLD (AWG) is a 100% gold-backed token on the Ethereum blockchain that is minted by a network of
  esteemed traders from the traditional gold market. Each AWG token is fully collateralized by, and redeemable
  for 1 gram of 99.99% gold (sourced from LBMA-accredited refineries), stored in fully audited and insured
  vaults.

  gold market in a digital way. Aurus offers a blockchain protocol that interacts with a semi-decentralized
  network of gold providers, vaults and distribution channels that work in synergy to autonomously tokenize
  physical bullions into AurusGOLD (AWG).


  Aurus is setting out to deliver a stable value to the crypto space, a highly liquid and global investment
  solution to the financial markets and ultimately, an alternative to mainstream payment methods.
