description: >-
  Stably Dollar (USDS) is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin created by Stably, Inc. Each Stably Dollar
  token is legally backed and redeemable for a US Dollar held in FDIC-insured escrow accounts managed
  by our fiduciary custodians, such as Prime Trust.


  The biggest and most obvious problem with using popular cryptocurrencies for transactional purposes
  at the moment is price volatility. By making Stably Dollar redeemable and pegged 1-to-1 with US dollars,
  we can virtually eliminate volatility while still retaining many useful characteristics of a cryptocurrency
  - including fast transaction speed, anonymity, and immutability.
