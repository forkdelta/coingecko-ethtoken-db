  Stably USD (formerly “StableUSD”), also known as USDS, is a US Dollar-pegged stablecoin fully backed
  1-to-1 and redeemable for USD held in an FDIC-insured trust account managed by Prime Trust, a state-chartered
  trust company in Nevada who is the token’s official regulated trustee and administrator.


  USDS is based on the ERC-20 token standard for Ethereum and the BEP-2 standard for Binance Chain at
  the moment and we will expand USDS to more blockchain protocols in the future, including EOS and Stellar.
