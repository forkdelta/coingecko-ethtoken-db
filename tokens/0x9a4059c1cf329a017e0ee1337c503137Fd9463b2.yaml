description: >-
  Lucyd is developing an AR smartglass platform. The LCD token will be used on Lucyd's platform to power
  a decentralized app store, to purchase hardware from Lucyd, for rapid peer-to-peer transactions in AR
  smartglasses, to reward high quality app developers, and reward community engagement. Our mission is
  to make truly user-friendly smartglasses, and a blockchain-based AR app ecosystem. Lucyd owns a portfolio
  of 13 unique, exclusively-licensed AR patents that will allow for the development of an interactive
  AR display that is lightweight, ergonomic, comfortable, has a wide field of view, auto-adjusts to lighting
  conditions, accommodates corrective lenses and appears like a normal pair of glasses. Lucyd Lens will
  be an AR peripheral compatible with existing Android and iOS devices and apps, while also supporting
  Lucyd-native content.
