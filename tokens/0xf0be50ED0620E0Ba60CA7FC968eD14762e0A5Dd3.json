If you hold on to your COWs, I'd say theres around a 10% chance them bulls will be breeding your COWs in no time! The total number of COWs seems to go up around 1.5% a day, though this might taper off after a while, guess the bulls will get all worn out.\n\nI gotta warn you though, there's something fishy been going on, and I ain't talking about no SHRIMP! Rumour has it, that every time the butchers start paying more for the COWs, some pesky bandits come and steal a bunch of them away.
