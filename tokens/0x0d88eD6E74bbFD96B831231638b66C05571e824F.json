Organisers can create, manage and promote their events and tickets with dramatically reduced platform costs, and can set price controls and receive commissions on secondary market sales.\n\nThe Aventus Protocol:  Blockchain for Ticketing\nAn open-source protocol that delivers the global standard for ticketing. The protocol permits rights holders to define rules across the ticketing supply-chain - including promoters, venues primary / secondary agents - to which everyone must adhere.\n\nTHE AVENTUS TOKEN (AVT)\nIt is essential for aligning the economic incentives in the secure and transparent network to ensure fraudulent behaviour is identified and eliminated.\n\nAVT is used by the network in 3 key ways:\n1. Voting on the legitimacy of events in the protocol\nA means to prevent spamming in the network, and to ensure that all entities across the ticket supply chain, who will be interacting with the inventory, can contribute to the due diligence process, which is currently undertaken by a single entity.\n\n2. Creating a token-curated registry of legitimate applications\nUsing the protocol in order that ticketing rights holders and consumers have a single source of truth for verifying that the ticketing application in question is using the protocol legitimately and not circumventing rules via off-chain fees and terms and conditions.\n\n3. Facilitating the non-deterministic matching of buyers and sellers of tickets in the secondary market\nBy using proof of stake-like mechanisms. This is essential for preventing secondary market participants from circumventing the rules imposed by the rights holder, leading to unregulated resale.","developer_score":10.967,"id":"aventus","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/901/large/aventus.png?1547034729","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/901/small/aventus.png?1547034729","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/901/thumb/aventus.png?1547034729"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1955231,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0d88ed6e74bbfd96b831231638b66c05571e824f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0d88ed6e74bbfd96b831231638b66c05571e824f"],"facebook_username":"AventusPF","homepage":["https://aventus.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AventusSystems/aventus-dapp-proposals","https://github.com/AventusSystems/bronze-protocol"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Aventus","twitter_screen_name":"AventusSystems"},"liquidity_score":6.701,"market_cap_rank":699,"name":"Aventus","public_interest_score":0.002,"symbol":"avt","tickers":[{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"AVT","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"0X0D88ED6E74BBFD96B831231638B66C05571E824F","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap (v2)"},"target":"ETH"}]}
