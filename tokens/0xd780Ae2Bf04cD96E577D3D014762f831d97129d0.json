By harvesting locally available clean energy right at the source, Envion can operate at a lower cost than competitors and at the same time reduce the CO2 footprint of the blockchain industry. Envion aims at decentralizing the highly-concentrated mining market and at bringing back control of the market to the users. Hence, profits generated by MMUs are 100% beneficial to token holders. Distribution of profit dividends will occur on a weekly basis: 75% of profits will be emitted, while 25% will be used to reinvest directly in MMUs, in order to guarantee exponentially growing profits to the envion community.","developer_score":17.564,"id":"envion","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1547/large/envion.jpg?1547035704","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1547/small/envion.jpg?1547035704","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1547/thumb/envion.jpg?1547035704"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xd780ae2bf04cd96e577d3d014762f831d97129d0","https://etherscan.io/token/0xd780ae2bf04cd96e577d3d014762f831d97129d0","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd780ae2bf04cd96e577d3d014762f831d97129d0"],"facebook_username":"envion.org","homepage":["https://www.envion.org/en/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/envion/Smart-Contracts"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"envion","twitter_screen_name":"Envion_org"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":2172,"name":"Envion","public_interest_score":25.856,"symbol":"evn","tickers":[{"base":"EVN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"EVN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"EVN","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]}
