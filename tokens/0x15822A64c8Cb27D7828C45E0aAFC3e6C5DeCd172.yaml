  "The crypto market behaviour is very emotional. People tend to get greedy when the market is rising.
  Also, people often sell their coins in irrational reaction when the market turns red. The Fear & Greed
  Set, will try to save you from your own emotional overreaction.


  Rebalances will take place on the 2nd day we are below 20 or above 80, or if we have a 40 point change
  from a previous rebalance.

  Data explaining how the set and its parameters came to be can be found here:
