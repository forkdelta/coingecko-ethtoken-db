  Gnosis is a prediction market platform built as a decentralized application (dapp) on the Ethereum network.
  The platform includes a multisig wallet as well as a Dutch Exchange, but we’re just going to focus on
  their flagship product, the prediction market, for this guide. More than just building a prediction
  market, though, Gnosis is creating an entire infrastructure layer that you can use to build your own
  prediction market app. A prediction market utilizes user predictions to aggregate information about
  future events.


  Users in the market trade tokens that represent the outcome of a certain event. Because some outcomes
  are more likely to occur than others, these tokens end up having different values in the open market.Olympia
  is Gnosis’s test version of their prediction market app. They host free tournaments in this product,
  so you get a chance to try it out without having to spend money. Every two days, the team allocates
  you a certain amount of Olympia (OLY) tokens that you use to bet on different prediction markets. If
  you do well in the market, you win Gnosis (GNO) tokens. You can sell GNO on the open market which gives
  them some monetary value. The next phase of Gnosis is its Management Interface. The team released a
  beta version in December 2017 but haven’t announced a date for the main net release. The Management
  Interface is basically your dashboard for Gnosis’s prediction markets. It’s here that you check your
  balance, participate in markets, and even create your own market.


  Gnosis includes two types of tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO are the ERC20 tokens that the team sold
  during their ICO. They created 10 million GNO tokens and aren’t minting any additional ones. These are
  the tokens that you see being traded on the open market. By staking GNO, you receive OWL tokens. To
  do this, you must lock your GNO in a smart contract making them non-transferable. The amount of OWL
  you receive is dependent on the length of your lock period as well as the total supply of OWL tokens
  in the market. The team is aiming to have 20x more total OWL than the average amount of monthly OWL
  usage over the previous 3 months.


  The Gnosis team is led by Martin Köppelmann (CEO), Stefan George (CTO), and Dr. Friederike Ernst (COO).
  Köppelmann and George began working on the platform in January 2015 as one of the first ConsenSys partners.
  By August of that same year, they launched the alpha product as the first major dapp on Ethereum. In
  April 2017, the project held somewhat of a controversial <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/gnosis">Initial
  Coin Offering (ICO)</a>. Using a dutch auction style of raising funds, the team hit their $12.5 million
  hard cap in ten minutes while retaining 95% of the tokens. Amidst backlash, the team locked the tokens
  in a vault and have promised not to dump them on the market. They’ll give at least a three-month warning
  before selling any of the tokens. The team includes quite a list of reputable advisors including Joseph
  Lubin (Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder) and Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder and chief scientist).
