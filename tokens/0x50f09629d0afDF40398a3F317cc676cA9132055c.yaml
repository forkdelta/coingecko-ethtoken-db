  Evai is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) presenting a world-class decentralised ratings
  platform for crypto, DeFi and NFT-based assets that can be used by anyone to evaluate these new asset
  classes.


  Through a combination of peer-reviewed financial research and economic modelling, Evai provides decentralised
  and impartial ratings based on a multi-factor AI & ML model that removes the need for human intervention.


  Evai encourages community engagement through a distributed token-based governance system that allows
  EVAI holders to vote and reach consensus on platform upgrades, security protocols and which cryptoasset
  instruments are added next to the ratings platform.
