  Ankr strives to build a resource efficient blockchain framework that truly enables Distributed Cloud
  Computing (DCC) and provides user-friendly infrastucture for business applications. There are indeed
  existing cloud solutions, but Ankr is the first one to leverage both blockchain and trusted hardware.


  Technology Overview

  Ankr provides a computation-resource-efficient blockchain and an integrated data feed system leveraging
  both cryptographic primitives and trusted hardware


  Proof of Useful Work

  The Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) consensus enables a self-sustainable blockchain framework. Instead of
  wasting electricity and computing power on hashes like Bitcoin does, PoUW uses these resources towards
  useful work tasks provided by enterprises and consumers. The protocol runs on SGX-enabled CPUs with
  remote attestation to ensure security and confidentiality. The novel PoUW approach unlocks the massive
  potential of idle computing power around the world by providing enough incentives: in this scheme, every
  computation contributor gets compensated, and some will get the extra reward for generating the blocks.
  In the future, this mining scheme can promote Universal Basic Income (UBI).


  Plasma Sidechains

  The Multi-chain Plasma implementation allows different applications to handle application-specific smart
  contracts on individual side chains, preventing transactions from overloading the PoUW-based main chain.


  Native Oracle Service

  Native Oracle Service (NOS) provides authenticated data feed by leveraging both cryptographic primitives
  and the trusted execution environment (TEE). Through a standardized API to port data from existing websites,
  NOS enables simple real-world business adoption
