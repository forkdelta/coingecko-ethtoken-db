  The AUREI mechanism is a breakthrough innovation that will open a new path in token design for the future,
  based on a token issuance price function (price increase factor) instead of a token issuance time function
  (either initially or at a later stage during the life of the token).

  AUREI Project is a paradigm shift for the concept of token creation. Usually token creation dilutes
  former investor, here this effect is structurally different thanks to the token design: the price of
  the token must necessarily rise substantially for a new token issuance to take place.
