description: >-
  The Compound Governance Token is a governance token on the Compound Finance lending protocol, COMP allows
  the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user,
  an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Compound governance by receiving delegation,
  without needing to own COMP.


  Anybody with 1% of COMP delegated to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple
  or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new asset, changing an asset’s collateral factor,
  changing a market’s interest rate model, or changing any other parameter or variable of the protocol
  that the current administrator can modify.
