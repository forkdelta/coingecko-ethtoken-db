description: >-
  The Delta ecosystem started with a Limited Staking Window (LSW). Users were able to contribute Ethereum
  to the LSW which was used to create liquidity for the Ethereum / Delta Pair on Uniswap. rLP tokens were
  given in return to the participants.

  rLP tokens have a special attribute of periodically rebasing its underlying liquidity and therefore
  increasing their mint price exponentially. To create maximum value for our early community members,
  a special launching event was designed called Limited Staking Window. Participants staked Ethereum in
  the launch contract, in return they receive rLP tokens. After the LSW closes, liquidity rebasing will
  significantly increase the minting price (~150%), making participation in the LSW much more cost efficient,
  compared to minting rLP tokens post launch.
