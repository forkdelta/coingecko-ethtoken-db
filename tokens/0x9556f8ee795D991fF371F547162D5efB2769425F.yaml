  THE PROBLEM


  Data farming from big messaging companies (whatsapp, line, wechat, snapchat) are all owned by large
  corporations (whatsapp=facebook), as you know. The private data doesn't belong to you, the end-user's.
  You give your information freely in trade for a free application. You, are the product and that is the
  agreement you adhere to. You cannot trust whatsapp (it doesnt advertise itself as a secure app, and
  Telegram, despite a reputation of being secure, may not be as secure as you think it is).

  Telegram is not transparent.



  SOLUTION


  *Paid app to avoid other means from the company to generate income decentralized, no access to data,
  which is fully secured (with auditable encryption)
      *A real-use case communication system in encrypted chat (100% anonymous) combined with a currency
  exchange system among users in the same application. Essentially it's an app and messenger with an integrated
  currency function.
      * 2p2 payment system among chat users (collection of dividends by the holders from the sales of
  a app in Android and the website)
