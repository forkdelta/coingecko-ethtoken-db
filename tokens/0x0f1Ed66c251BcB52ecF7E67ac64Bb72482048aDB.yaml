description: >-
  SEER is a next-generation blockchain-based decentralized prediction market built on the Graphene toolkit.
  It allows users to express their judgments about future events by means of the market mechanism and
  makes effective predictions by gathering intelligence and ideas. Equipped with multiple-hosts decentralized
  Oracles, SEER offers users credible decentralized prediction market service. Also, SEER Committee and
  a mechanism of arbitration have been set up to maintain high efficiency, impartiality and self-government.
  In the early stage, SEERâ€™s project team mainly focuses on building a bottom blockchain layer and compiling
  smart contract s on a basic prediction market feature. Apart from this, SEER pursues extensive collaboration
  with data providers, aiming to connect blockchain and the real world, and narrow the gap between the

  upstream industries and users. In the middle of the SEER project and its development route, customized
  development projects will be launched, such as sports betting, finance market prediction, assets price
  prediction and event prediction.
