  "The aXpire mission of generating savings for clients is shaped by having 17+ years of experience in
  the software development space through their sister company LSG, or Legal Solutions Group, a company
  that has been creating and servicing “household” names such as Coca-Cola, Nike, IBM, Intel, KFC, NFL
  and beyond with legal software solutions that have saved clients $1.2 billion dollars in total.


  As a company, aXpire was created as an offshoot of LSG in 2017 when a large top 10 global hedge fund
  needed a specific software solution. It was decided to separate aXpire as a new company, which then
  won the contract to supply this large global hedge fund with a custom, tailor-made fund software solution
  called ""Resolvr"".


  Since then, the company has built out a number of new solutions, including a legal billing software,
  an expense management software, and a cryptocurrency payments application for iOS and Android.


  The AXPR token was launched on Ethereum (ERC20) and Binance Chain (BEP2) as an extension of aXpire in
  early 2018, with advisors Roger Ver, Mate Tokay, Shingo Lavine, and a host of other advisory board backers
  within the fund and legal industry spheres. The AXPR token is involved with all of aXpire's B2B and
  B2C products, with product fee discounts and more. It's most central aspect is the burn function, however,
  wherein 5% of all company revenues from fees, software sales, and beyond are used to buy and burn AXPR
  tokens, reducing supply."
