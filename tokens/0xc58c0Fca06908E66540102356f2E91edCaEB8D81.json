The core concept revolves around the in-built burning function of NUKE tokens upon any transaction that transfers NUKE tokens.\n\nWith a 2% burn rate; 2% of any amount of NUKE tokens transferred between wallets will burn; NUKE will theoretically become an optimal storage of value as the supply decreases and demand increases with every NUKE transaction. The burned tokens are completely removed from circulation, and no longer exist.\n\nNUKE has been designed to be a platform as well as a token, and thus dApps can be coded and launched on the NUKE ecosystem using the native token. Projects like these are rare in crypto, where a coin can have both an ever-increasing intrinsic storage of value as well as a functional use case by way of decentralized applications.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"half-life","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8734/large/NUKE-logo-200x200.png?1560757684","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8734/small/NUKE-logo-200x200.png?1560757684","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8734/thumb/NUKE-logo-200x200.png?1560757684"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc58c0Fca06908E66540102356f2E91edCaEB8D81"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/6yWt6Xv"],"homepage":["http://nuketoken.com/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nukeme/","telegram_channel_identifier":"Nuketoken","twitter_screen_name":"NukeToken"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Half Life","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"nuke","tickers":[]}
