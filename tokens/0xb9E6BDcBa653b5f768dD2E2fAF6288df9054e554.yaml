description: >-
  Dirham is a token backed by actual assets, including AED and USD. One Dirham equals one underlying unit
  of the currency backing it, AED / USD, and is backed 100% by actual assets in the Dirham platform’s
  reserve account. Being anchored or “tethered” to real world currency, Dirham provides protection from
  the volatility of cryptocurrencies.


  Dirham enables businesses – including exchanges, wallets, payment processors, financial services, and
  ATMs – to easily use fiat-backed tokens on blockchains. By leveraging Blockchain technology, Dirham
  allows you to store, send and receive digital tokens person-to-person, globally, instantly, and securely
  for a fraction of the cost of alternatives.
