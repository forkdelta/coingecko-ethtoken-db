description: >-
  The BASED Protocol is a DeFi game of chicken designed to shake out weak hands and yield the highest
  gains for those who understand the rules.


  The $BASED token combines a simplified version of Ampleforth’s economic policy with YFI’s distribution
  mechanism.


  The result is a post-modern economic game that continually resets. The barrier of entry is fair and
  balanced for all participants.


  The only rule of BASED is that no one can change the rules. There are no owners, and because the private
  keys have been burned, the contracts cannot be changed. This makes an exit scam impossible.
