  Datarius serves as a direct link between lenders, borrowers, and the related services – managers, analysts,
  insurance companies, funds, trading terminals.


  Datarius main task is to provide people from all over the world with a free and equal access to the
  maximum number of financial products. Our primary mission is to create an entirely new transparent financial
  product. To provide a customer with clear tools and greater opportunities. To ensure freedom of choice
  and action.
