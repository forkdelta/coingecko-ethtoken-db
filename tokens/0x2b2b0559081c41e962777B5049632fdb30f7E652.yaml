description: >-
  BitDEFi (BFi) is a fully-embedded governance, loyalty discounts, and deflationary mechanisms at its
  core. Decisions made on the DeFiat network are voted on and fully orchestrated by BFi holders. Every
  time a transaction occurs on the network, a fee is distributed to network participants and tokens are
  burned to facilitate the transaction, naturally decreasing supply. Transaction fees are repurposed as
  staking rewards, creating a circular economy.
