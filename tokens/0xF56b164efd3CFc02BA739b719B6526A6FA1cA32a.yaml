  Curio Governance launched in 25/12/2020 by a team based in Switzerland, Curio Governance is part of
  the Curio Stable–°oin Protocol and allows CGT token holders to participate in the governance and improvement
  of the protocol. Governance is based on the DAO model and supports 2 types of votes: direct protocol
  control by CGT-holders and community service polls. Curio StableCoin Protocol allows people to use Security
  Tokens (supported Curio Car Tokens) as collateral to generate Curio StableCoin, and also make deposits
  to Curio StableCoin to generate passive income.
