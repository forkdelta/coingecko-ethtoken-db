  Fetch.AI ("the Project") brings together machine learning ("ML"), artificial intelligence ("AI"), multi-agent
  systems and decentralized ledger technology to create an economic internet — an environment where digital
  representatives of the economy's moving parts (such as data, hardware, services, people and infrastructure)
  can get useful work done through effective introductions and predictions


  These agents can be thought of as digital entities: life-forms that are able to make decisions on their
  own behalf as well as on behalf of their stakeholders (individuals, private enterprises and governments
  for example). Fetch.AI's digital world is exposed to agents via its Open Economic Framework (OEF) and
  is underpinned by unique smart ledger technology to deliver high performance, low cost transactions.
  The ledger delivers useful proof-of-work that builds market intelligence and trust over time — growing
  the value of the network as it is used. Fetch.AI can be neatly interfaced to existing systems with minimal
  effort, allowing it to take advantage of the old economy whilst building the new: plug existing data
  in to Fetch.AI and watch markets spontaneously form from the bottom up.
