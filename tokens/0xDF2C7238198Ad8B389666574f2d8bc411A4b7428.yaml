description: >-
  Mainframe is the platform for decentralized applications. Resistant to censorship, surveillance, and
  disruption, the Mainframe network enables any application to send data, store files, manage payments,
  run tasks, and more. With the exception of a catastrophic asteroid event or an aggressive alien invasion,
  the Mainframe network is simply unstoppable. We build with five fundamental principles as our guide.


  The Mainframe network is the messaging layer for the new web. This goes beyond human-to-human messaging.
  There are many use-cases and applications for reliably, privately, and securely routing data packets
  through the Mainframe peer-to-peer network. Mainframe is resistant to censorship, surveillance, and
  disruption. With the exception of a catastrophic asteroid event or an aggressive alien invasion, the
  Mainframe network is simply unstoppable. We build with five fundamental principles as our guide.


  The Mainframe platform is a developer-friendly SDK providing all these services in a secure peer-to-peer
  fashion. It is designed to be modular and pluggable, so developers and users can configure which projects
  they prefer to use for the underlying service layers. Our mission is to delight developers by providing
  an SDK that is well-documented, supported and backed by strong developer communities.


  Because it is not always clear which projects will gain the most momentum, and because developers often
  have varying preferences, we feel that it is important to design our underlying service architecture
  to be modular and pluggable, allowing developers and users to configure which projects they prefer to
  use for each service layer and abstracting away as much of the differences as possible. A single medium
  of exchange in the form of Mainframe tokens (MFT) is also used to improve the developer and user experience.
  Where underlying service layers cannot be retrofitted to accept MFT, we will implement atomic swaps
  between native service-layer tokens and MFT.
