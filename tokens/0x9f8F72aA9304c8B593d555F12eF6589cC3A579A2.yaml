  MKR is a cryptocurrency depicted as a smart contract platform and works alongside the Dai coin and aims
  to act as a hedge currency that provides traders with a stable alternative to the majority of coins
  currently available on the market. Maker offers a transparent stablecoin system that is fully inspectable
  on the Ethereum blockchain. Founded almost three years ago, MakerDao is lead by Rune Christensen, its
  CEO and founder. Maker’s MKR coin is a recent entrant to the market and is not a well known project.
  However, after today it will be known by many more people after blowing up 40% and it is one of the
  coins to rise to prominence during the recent peaks and troughs.


  After being developed by the MakerDAO team, Maker Dai officially went live on December 18th, 2017. Dai
  is a price stable coin that is suitable for payments, savings, or collateral and provides cryptocurrency
  traders with increased options concerning opening and closing positions. Dai lives completely on the
  blockchain chain with its stability unmediated by the legal system or trusted counterparties and helps
  facilitate trading while staying entirely in the world of cryptocurrencies. The concept of a stablecoin
  is fairly straight forward – it’s a token that has its price or value pegged to a particular fiat currency.
  A stablecoin is a token (like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a
  href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>) that exists on a blockchain, but unlike
  Bitcoin or Ethereum, Dai has no volatility.


  MKR is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain and can not be mined. It’s instead created/destroyed
  in response to DAI price fluctuations in order to keep it hovering around $1 USD. MKR is used to pay
  transaction fees on the Maker system, and it collateralizes the system. Holding MKR comes with voting
  rights within Maker’s continuous approval voting system. Bad governance devalues MKR tokens, so MKR
  holders are incentivized to vote for the good of the entire system. It’s a fully decentralized and democratic
  structure, then, which is an underutilized USP of blockchain tech.


  Value volatility is a relative concept among both cryptos and fiat currencies. The US dollar, for example,
  was worth 110.748 yen on July 9, 2018. On July 4, 2011, $1 was worth 80.64 yen, and on March 18, 1985,
  $1 was worth 255.65 yen. These are major differences in exchange rates, and inflation within each country
  makes each currency worth different values even when compared to themselves. One USD in 1913 is worth
  the equivalent of $25.41 today, and even $1 in 1993 is worth the equivalent of $1.74 today. Stablecoins
  don’t negate these basic economic principles of value. Instead, both Tether and Dai have values pegged
  to the U.S. dollar. This is done to stabilize the price.
