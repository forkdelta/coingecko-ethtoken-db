  Status is a mobile operating system that will completely change the way the world interacts with the
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> network.  Designed as a decentralized
  browser and private messenger, Status allows you to connect to the entire Ethereum network right in
  the palm of your hand. Status provides you access to all of Ethereum’s decentralized applications (dapps)
  through an app on your smartphone. It opens the door to mass adoption of Ethereum dapps by targeting
  the fastest growing computer segment in the world – smartphone users.


  The creators behind Status are working towards bringing a decentralized world to life. Status essentially
  combines a messenger and a browser that allows everyday smartphone users to use decentralized applications,
  also known as dapps. Status is available on both Android and iOS. Status users can safely send, receive,
  and store Ether and other Ethereum crypto assets on their phone. They can also discover nearby Status
  users to exchange currency, services, and ideas locally.


  The first time the world heard about the idea of Status was September 2016, at DevCon2, an annual conference
  for developers on the Ethereum blockchain. Co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlbennetts/">Carl
  Bennetts</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarradhope/">Jarrad Hope</a> gave a presentation
  revealing the plans for their Ethereum light client.


  SNT is currently available for trade on many online exchanges, including <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/huobi">Huobi</a>,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bittrex">Bittrex</a>.
