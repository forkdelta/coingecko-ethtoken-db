  Auroracoin is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, and secure cryptocurrency released as an alternative to
  the Icelandic Króna to bypass governmental restrictions associated with the national fiat currency.
  It was launched with the aim of becoming the ‘official’ cryptocurrency of Iceland. AUR was a pioneer
  in the area of country-specific cryptocurrencies. AUR was launched on the 25th of January, 2014, by
  an anonymous developer who went by the pseudonym of Baldur Friggjar Óðinsson. It was originally based
  on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin">Litecoin</a>, using the Scrypt algorithm with
  a Proof of Work mechanism, but was later updated to use a multi-algorithm architecture in 2016, forked
  from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/digibyte">DigiByte</a>.


  Auroracoin uses the PoW consensus mechanism, which utilises device hashing power to solve a complex
  mathematical problem in order to authenticate a transaction proposed to be stored in the blockchain.
  The difficulty of solving the problem ensures that authenticating forged transactions is very difficult
  unless the attacker owns an impractically large chunk of the network’s total hashing power. AUR is one
  of the only cryptocurrencies to use a combination of five different hashing algorithms, namely Grøstl,
  Qubit, scrypt, SHA-256, and Skein.


  While initially very popular, Auroracoin has seen little to no activity for a while, with poor marketing,
  and frequent dev team changes. Reasons for little growth have been various, from slow adoption in Iceland,
  to developers leaving and joining the project midway. However, it is expected to not go lower than the
  recent low, and might see a rise as AUR plans to launch a more aggressive marketing campaign in Iceland
  to promote the coin among the masses. Unlike most other altcoins, Auroracoin has made extensive changes
  to the original codebase. It has introduced security measures such as Automatic checkpointing, and protecting
  against known flaws present in the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">BTC</a> blockchain,
  such as 51% block replacement attacks.
