  "Froge.finance (FROGE) is the first eco-token in crypto. It was launched to deal with two great issues
  of our time: the protection of the rainforest and the lack of interest on your savings account.


  The rainforest is of vital importance to the worldâ€™s eco-system. That is why Coolearth stands by rainforest
  communities in their fight against deforestation and climate change. FROGE is a fundraiser for Coolearth:
  0,1% of all transactions end up in the Coolearth wallet and saving trees.
