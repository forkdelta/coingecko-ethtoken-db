  BTA Protocol is a knowledge economy unlocking blockchain education and opportunities of decentralized
  finance while contributing to charities.


  With every transaction of BTAP token, there is a tax of 1% of the amount being sent.


  0.5% goes to all token holders.

  0.25 % will be burned and be taken out of circulation until 50

  million token supply at which point 0.25% will be bolted on to the 0.5%

  going to token holders.

  0.25 % will go to the Beacon wallet, which is our charity wallet with an initial base value of 10 million
  tokens.
