  Rentberry is a transparent home rental service and a price negotiation platform uniting tenants and
  landlords. It automates all the standard rental tasks from submitting your personal information, credit
  reports and custom offers, to e-signing rental agreements and online rental payments. Welcome to the
  Rentberry neighborhood – where new tenants are moving in every day!


  Tired of secretive bids? Rentberry is the only platform that provides a transparent rental auction with
  the ability to submit custom offers. See the current highest proposal and the number of people who applied
  for the property, so you can make an informed decision.


  Apply for Your Future Home

  No need to overpay. Once you’ve attended an open house, simply fill out an online personalized application.
  You can also invite your roommates to apply for the same property. Attach your credit and background
  reports to make a better impression and seal the deal faster.


  Pay Rent Online

  Say goodbye to paper checks! Use Rentberry to schedule your next rental payment. Our secure ACH payment
  technology allows to connect bank accounts and make rental payments instantly. Sharing the rent? No
  problem! With Rentberry, you can conveniently split the payments with your roommates.


  E-Sign Rental Agreement

  Your application has been approved – congratulations! No need to run across the town to sign a paper
  contract. We partnered with HelloSign to offer you the ability to execute legally binding documents
  online. Rentberry uses SSL encryption technology and provides a secure storage for your contracts.


  Schedule Tours Online

  Found a perfect place? Schedule a tour and see how it looks in real life. Rentberry makes tours scheduling
  easy as 1-2-3. Pick among dates suggested by a landlord and we’ll inform him about your choice. Or suggest
  your own date and wait until a landlord approves it.


  Request Maintenance Service

  Maintenance requests are no longer headaches. Tired of making dozens of back-and-forth phone calls or
  writing emails about a broken sink? Should an issue occur during a long-term apartment renting, just
  describe it briefly and set the priority of your maintenance request.
