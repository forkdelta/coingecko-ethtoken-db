description: >-
  When it comes to online advertising, businesses are forced to pay exorbitant amounts of money to 'middlemen'
  in order to reach a captive audience for their promotions. The promotions, however, often get placed
  among many other ads clogging up the space on crowded banners, or simply end up in someone's spam box.
  Businesses also have little to no guarantee that the traffic they generate on their promotions is genuine.
  In fact, nearly 50% of all advertising traffic is generated by bots, essentially defeating the entire
  purpose of advertising.
