  Golem is a decentralized supercomputer that is accessible by anyone. The system is made up of the combined
  power of user’s machines from personal PCs to entire datacenters. Golem is able to compute almost any
  tasks from CGI rendering through machine learning to scientific learning. It utilizes an <a href"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">ethereum</a>-based
  transaction system to clear payments between providers, requestors and software developers however it
  is safe because all computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the
  hosts’ systems.


  The company released Brass in 2016 which includes Blender and LuxRender which are the two tools for
  CGI rendering. There are three releases that follows which are Clay, Stone and Iron. Golem has recently
  updated their Brass Beta and the highlight of this upgrade are the streamlined task creation GUI, the
  support for partial task restart in case of subtask timeouts and the fix that should alleviate the issues
  with the Docker service on Windows. Other than that, improvements have been made on the Blender verification
  and transaction tracking subsystems and fixed some minor pain-points in the UX. Transaction history
  will become more user-friendly with separate tabs for payments and incomes. Apart from that, improvements
  are made for requestors as well, requestors is now able to add resource file without having to repeat
  the task creation procedure if they have forgotten to add them beforehand.


  Grand vision and core features

  ● Golem is the first truly decentralized supercomputer, creating a global market for computing power.
  Combined with flexible tools to aid developers in securely distributing and monetizing their software,
  Golem altogether changes the way compute tasks are organized and executed. By powering decentralized
  microservices and asynchronous task execution, Golem is set to become a key building block for future
  Internet service providers and software development. And, by substantially lowering the price of computations,
  complex applications such as CGI rendering, scientific calculation, and machine learning become more
  accessible to everyone.


  ● Golem connects computers in a peer-to-peer network, enabling both application owners and individual
  users ("requestors") to rent resources of other users’ ("providers") machines. These resources can be
  used to complete tasks requiring any amount of computation time and capacity. Today, such resources
  are supplied by centralized cloud providers which, are constrained by closed networks, proprietary payment
  systems, and hard-coded provisioning operations. Also core to Golem’s built-in feature set is a dedicated
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market">Ethereum-based</a> transaction
  system, which enables direct payments between requestors, providers, and software developers.


  ● The function of Golem as the backbone of a decentralized market for computing power can be considered
  both Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), as well as Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). However, Golem reveals
  its true potential by adding dedicated software integrations to the equation. Any interested party is
  free to create and deploy software to the Golem network by publishing it to the Application Registry.
  Together with the Transaction Framework, developers can also extend and customize the payment mechanism
  resulting in unique mechanisms for monetizing software.
