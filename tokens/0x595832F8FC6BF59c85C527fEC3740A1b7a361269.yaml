  Power Ledger (POWR) is an Australian blockchain-based cryptocurrency and energy trading platform that
  allows for decentralized selling and buying of renewable energy. The platform provides consumers with
  access to a variety of energy markets around the globe and is meant to be scalable to various energy
  infrastructures and regulations. The market is based on a dual-token ecosystem operating on two blockchain
  layers, POWR and Sparkz. POWR tokens allow consumers and hosts providing energy to interface with the
  ecosystem and are protected through Smart Bond technology. POWR tokens can be converted into Sparkz
  tokens, which can be used for frictionless transactions in the energy exchange market. The initial coin
  offering for POWR tokens became the largest crowd funding project in Australia and the 14th highest
  in the world.


  Power Ledger’s team has immense expertise in both blockchain and electricity markets. They’re comprised
  of six Board of Directors in addition to over ten full time-team members. Power Leger’s five co-founders
  make up five of the six Board of Director seats of the company. The sixth board seat belongs to venture
  capitalist Bill Tai. Receiving his MBA from Harvard, Yai is a world-renowned venture capitalist. Tai’s
  experience is quite extensive; he is currently the Chairman of Treasure Data and also a Board Member
  of Bitfury and Boxer.


  Power Ledger’s POWR Presale sold out in just three days and raised over thirteen million dollars (AUD)
  in exchange for 190,000,000 tokens. After the presale, Power Ledger held an ICO to sell the remaining
  160,000,000 POWR tokens allocated to Token Generation Event.  After both rounds, funds raised totaled
  thirty-four million dollars (AUD). In addition to money raised from its presale and ICO, the Australian
  Government also awarded Power ledger a grant for 8 million dollars (AUD) to develop its technology and
  concept further. (Australia has one of the highest costs of electricity in the world and thus has a
  large stake in the overall success the company).


  Power Ledger provides a blockchain-based marketplace that can truly change the world. Taking power away
  from large energy companies, Power Ledger gives local communities the ability to sell their excess solar
  power to neighbors. Power Ledger has created an energy distribution and tracking platform that allows
  consumers buy carbonless, sustainable energy at lower prices than what’s offered by traditional electric
  companies. Power Ledger has plans to expand its operations to three continents worldwide and has amassed
  an army of powerful strategic partners to help achieve its goals.  With the planned release of multiple
  applications for its platform in the immediate future, the project has positioned itself to disrupt
  multiple energy markets throughout the world creating a bright future for all participants involved
  in this green revolution.
