  AppCoins is a protocol for the App Economy created by the Aptoide App Store, and the first ICO serving
  200 million users with the goal of creating a trustworthy economy without intermediaries. The AppCoins
  project was designed to foster innovation in technology. To create a universal digital advertising protocol
  for mobile devices, the developers at Aptoide designed AppCoins. AppCoins is an application-specific
  token which was designed to create a universal digital advertising protocol for mobile devices. It can
  be used to incentivize behavior which can then be used to raise money for the development of an app.
  Aptoide is the 3rd biggest app store with a with over 4 billion downloads and 1 million Apps. WIth over
  230,000,000 users, apps and support in 40 languages, more than 2.8 billion downloads, the cryptocoin
  can revolutionize how people use mobile technology and applications.


  AppCoins will bring in a range of standard protocols to be followed by all developers to advertise their
  games or apps in the app store.The “AppCoin” ERC20 token will bridge the gap between the advertisers
  and the users. A user earns 85% from every advertising investment that goes inside the app store. The
  user has to then use those coins to buy items (in-app purchases) inside the apps and games, thus, generating
  the return of the investment to the developers.

  Most industry enthusiasts believe that the immediate forecast of AppCoins price trends leans towards
  the downward slope. It is expected to be priced at an average price of ~$0.191 for a long while, with
  a few minor fluctuations.The trend is however, expected to stabilize at this point until Aptoide as
  a platform gains traction within the mobile usage industry.


  Once the ROI of the Aptoide platform starts multiplying significantly due to an increase in the number
  of users and developers on the network, the price will increase significantly and will correspond to
  good returns for investors.


  AppCoins is an innovative concept with a tidy site that conveys the underlying ideas well. As described
  above, investment in APPC is a favorable option for both developers and users. However, it is evident
  that the returns of the AppCoins’ solution are directly proportional to the development of the relationship
  of the App-store and the OEMs in the ecosystem. Thus, the amount of profit or returns gained by a trader
  will be a function of the ROI which the platform develops and its reputation in the crypto space.With
  almost 50% of the APPC coins in circulation as of July 2018, users have a good opportunity to buy them.
  However, it should be noted that it does not form a good investment option for a short period of time.
