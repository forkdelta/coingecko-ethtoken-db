  Vanilla is a single decentralised interface for all DeFi, which rewards you for making a profit trading
  tokens with a mechanism called profit mining. This is the process by which all VNL is created as there
  was no pre-mine. VNL is used for governance of the system where holders can tweak the profit mining
  incentives to direct capital to specific services or tokens they prefer.
