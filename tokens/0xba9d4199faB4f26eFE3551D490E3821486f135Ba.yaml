  SwissBorg is decentralising wealth management by making it fun, fair, and community-centric. Headquartered
  in Lausanne, Switzerland, SwissBorg has an international team of over 75 people and holds two licenses
  to provide Virtual Currency Exchange and Virtual Currency Wallets internationally. We believe that blockchain
  technology can empower everyone to control their wealth, and that decentralised wealth management is
  the next step towards a world of decentralised nations, where every individual is welcome and is fairly
  rewarded for their contributions.


  The Product: SwissBorg Wealth App


  Our flagship product, the Wealth App, allows users to securely exchange digital assets and invest with
  17 fiat currencies, with the protection of MPC keyless technology. In the app, our revolutionary Smart
  Engine takes the guesswork out of investing. By connecting to Binance, HitBTC, LMAX, and Kraken exchanges,
  we get you the best liquidity and rates in a matter of seconds.


  The Multi-Utility SwissBorg Token (CHSB)


  The CHSB token is at the heart of our ecosystem, and offers the 5 following utilities:


  A) The Protect & Burn Mechanism: 20% of the revenues made on fees in the Wealth App are dedicated to
  protecting the price of our token. When the price arrives in a bearish zone, we automatically place
  buy orders. All purchased CHSBs are then burned in a transparent manner.


  B) Staking: Lock CHSB within the Wealth App allows users to exchange at the best price with zero fees.


  C) Exclusive Access: Get access to future exclusive wealth management products in the app


  D) Voting Rights: Participate in shaping the future of SwissBorg during our referendums


  E) Community Rewards: Earn rewards through the SwissBorg DAO
