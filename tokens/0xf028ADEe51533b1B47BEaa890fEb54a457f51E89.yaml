  BMCHAIN presents a decentralized platform for active participants based on blockchain technologies.
  Each participant of the system can convert the accumulated knowledge and experience into a digital property
  with the possibility of using it to purchase goods and services in everyday life. An econometric model
  of the system was developed on the Biznes Molodost audience, the largest business community of Russia
  and the CIS, which will make it possible to take all the advantages of Blockchain technologies.


  The implemented functionality will allow thousands of people and entrepreneurs to share their experience,
  resources, capabilities and knowledge by writing posts, voting and commenting, thus getting a real value
  expressed in digital tokens of the system, easily convertible into other types of digital property and
  fiat currencies. Rewards can be received not only by the participants who demonstrate useful activity,
  but also by those who estimate their contribution.


  The main idea of the project is to measure, preserve and monetize the value (benefit) that arises in
  the process of communication between people and is expressed as a change in the reputation coefficient.
  Keeping the information about communication and monitoring the change in productivity, it is possible
  to effectively evaluate each participant's potential value for the system and its members, which can
  be expressed by the reputation coefficient. Reputation is used as the main multiplier determining the
  size of the reward received by the user from the system and its participants.


  Biznes Molodost community includes thousands of successful entrepreneurs providing a large number of
  goods and services which are demanded by real people and can be obtained in exchange for BMT tokens.


  An additional possibility of the BMCHAIN platform  or any business will be the opportunity to create
  its own Blockchain-application with the necessary logic based on the developed TokenAPI solution without
  the need to study the technical level of Blockchain.


  The partner accepting tokens for the payment is offered the automated possibility of conversion of the
  tokens received into roubles. To accept tokens the system participant must provide users with a list
  of goods or services including a real discount of at least 20%. The reputation of the partner providing
  quality products or services in exchange for tokens starts growing along with the bonus tokens credited
  for the usage of the system and the number of partner's incoming and outgoing transactions. The amount
  of bonus tokens obtained when making transactions depends on the reputation of the user and the partner.
