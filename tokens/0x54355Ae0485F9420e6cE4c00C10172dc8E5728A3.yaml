description: >-
  Ether Hoard is more aggressive strategy when compared to Dollar Yield, with higher profits. While it
  can have longer periods of deeper underperformance vs USD, it's fine tuned to be less volatile when
  measured in ETH. Crypto investors who are positive about ETH future and want to multiply ETH stash,
  should choose this strategy. It uses DAI, which is more decentralised than USDC and yields no interest,
  therefore it's well suited for investors who prefer not to invest in cUSDC for religious reasons.
