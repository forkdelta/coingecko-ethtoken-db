description: >-
  Dusk Network is a high throughput permissionless blockchain aimed at providing privacy, programmability
  and auditability.

  Dusk Network is currently in the Testnet phase and is a blockchain protocol for easy deployment of programmable
  zero-knowledge dApps, thus becoming the backbone of an open, permissionless and global privacy-oriented
  dApp ecosystem.

  Dusk Network aims to remove technical barriers that have undermined mainstream issuance and trading
  of security tokens. Compliance, auditability and privacy are built into the open, permissionless Confidential
  Security Token-standard (XSC).
