  Inverse Synthetic ETC


  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse Ethereum Classic (ETC) through price feeds supplied by an oracle.
  The entry point is $6.16 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when
  it reaches its upper limit of $9.24 (i.e. when Inverse Ethereum Classic's value reaches $3.08) or its
  lower limit of $3.08 (i.e. when Inverse Ethereum Classicâ€™s value reaches $9.24). If it reaches either
  of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but
  can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either
  of its limits, it will be substituted for another iETC with different limits.
