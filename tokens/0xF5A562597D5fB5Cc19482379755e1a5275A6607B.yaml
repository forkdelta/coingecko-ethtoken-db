  An innovative financial system will be created with XFOC.A blockchain generating blocks in 0.5 seconds
  can adequately function as a ledger management system for ordinary financial operations. XFOC has been
  developed as an original blockchain since 2014. BTC takes 10 minutes to generate a block, while even
  ETH, well known for its faster performance, requires 15 seconds.


  A XFOC's blockchain takes just 0.5 seconds for block generation. This speed allows our blockchain to
  serve as an alternative system for credit cards or e-money. XFOC is a next-generation blockchain solution
  for banks.We will provide services needed across the globe. You can open the bank account online.


  The dedicated XFOC app, WALLET, integrates and manages bank accounts in several currencies and cryptocurrencies.
  Banks that adopt XFOC will have SWIFT code. Therefore, it allows cash withdrawals and deposits at banks
  across the world. A CASHCARD will be issued to WALLET users. This card allows the withdrawal of cash
  at banking partners around the globe. XFOC also aims to participate in the QR code payment business
  to make the WALLET-based payment method available for use in stores and shops worldwide.


  XFOC token will start to be used by a bank in the spring of 2020.
