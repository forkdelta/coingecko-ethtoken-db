  "The Next-generation fully inclusive Digital Economy - We are expanding our secure and highly accessible
  platform to buy and sell from Africa


  With more than 7,500 accounts on our https://nuclus.io ecommerce platform MVP and a token distribution
  of just under 15 million we are growing fast. Our nuclex.exchange is also gaining in popularity but
  is not activated for trading yet.


  We introduce a new economic philosophy and to ensure sustainability and to advance equitable opportunities
  for economic participants during economic growth with benefits incurred by every section of society.


  We’ve built an eco-system to address the prosperity paradox in Africa


  In developing economies, vendors do not necessarily have access to bank accounts and therefore are unable
  to fully participate in global eCommerce.

  We introduce a new economic philosophy to ensure sustainability and to advance equitable opportunities
  for participants during economic growth with benefits incurred by and distributed to every section of
  society.


  For the first time in modern history, the global economy is growing but few are benefiting – until now,
  sellers have had to hold expensive merchant bank accounts and pay high fees making online business expensive
  and only profitable with high volume sales.


  The combination of mobile ubiquity and smartcontracts on the blockchain is unlocking opportunity for
  prosperity like never before. The Nuclus Platform will be the #1 marketplace for international order
  fulfillment from Sub-Saharan Africa already serving sellers from South Africa, Kenya and Ghana connecting
  with new buyers and realization of commercial goals and objectives.


  The introduction of digital tokens and exchange will stimulate trade between participants as it has
  no residual effects or distortions i.e. inflation and the transaction is totally completed at the point
  and time of exchange.


  NUCLUM or Nuclus Money is listed and trading on Bitcratic.com and token.store

  NUCLUM is also listed on Blockfolio.com tracking the token price

  Versatile Smart Contracts


  Smart contracts are self-executing, self-enforcing contracts and are governed by the explicit terms
  and conditions laid out within them.

  These virtual agreements facilitate the exchange of money, content, shares, property, or anything of
  value.

  The platform will include Smart Contracts and facilitate Micro-payments, our Loyalty Program, for Triple-entry
  Bookkeeping and Supply Chain Management
