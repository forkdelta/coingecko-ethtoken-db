description: >-
  In order for the sale of OTC stocks to take place in the market, OTC companies must register with

  the Korea Financial Investment Association. It is difficult to obtain information on initial start-ups
  other than those with high performance, and the reliability of information acquired through the

  OTC stock community is questionable. So investors are unable to rely on the accuracy of information
  and this is a great risk to consider.
