  Cardstack is an open-source framework and consensus protocol that makes blockchains usable and scalable
  for the mass market, creating a decentralized software ecosystem that can challenge today’s digital
  superpowers. Cardstack Token (CARD) is a utility token allowing end- users and businesses to use applications
  that interact with multiple blockchains, decentralized protocols, app-coin-backed dApps, and cloud-
  based services while paying a single on-chain transaction fee.


  The main value proposition of the Cardstack ICO is to breakdown the user experience of disparate software,
  cloud and blockchain silos which now exist on various levels of the digital world, allowing both developers
  and users to engage in customizable workflows. To overcome these disparate app silos, Cardstack offers
  a new UI, deployed via the web or as a peer-to-peer app, which turns each service created by open-source
  developers into a “card”. Each card comprises a visual embodiment of key information, whereby users
  can then connect related cards for any type of workflow or utility they desire. These cards are the
  point of interaction between local services, cloud-based services and blockchain services all on one
  interface called Cardstack Hub. Underlying the Cardstack ecosystem is the Cardstack Token (CARD), an
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>-based ERC20 token.


  The Cardstack Team comprises many open source contributors. Check out the full list of contributors
  here. Heading the development of Cardstack is Christopher Tse. Christopher holds a BSc in Computer Science
  from Columbia University and is the Co-Founder of Monegraph and dotBlockchain Media. He has also served
  as Senior Director of Innovation at Businessweek. Ed Faulkner is the Lead Developer at Cardstack. He
  holds a Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT. He has founded
  three of his own tech ventures of which all are currently operational. Hassan Abdel-Rahman is the Lead
  Blockchain Developer for Cardstack. He holds a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Colorado
  School of Mines. Previous roles include over 2 years as Senior Software Designer at Monegraph and Principal
  Engineer at McGraw-Hill Education.


  One of the most important features Cardstack will deploy is an entry channel payment system that does
  not require users to purchase cryptocurrency from an exchange. Users can simply pay with fiat, such
  as a credit card, to purchase CARD tokens directly on the platform, bypassing the need for any prior
  familiarity with crypto. Once users purchase CARD tokens, they are stored on a native wallet accessible
  from the Cardstack Hub. CARD tokens held in the native wallet are then used to purchase SSCs for every
  app and service they users with to access. To make any project appealing to the mass consumer market,
  this type of simplified entry into the cryptospace is a necessity. Cardstack have made some progress
  on the development front. The code for over 30 initial modules on the Cardstack platform has been made
  available via their Github. Also, the Solidity code for the Scalable Payment Pool has already been open-sourced.
  The Scalability Payment Pool is one of the core back-end mechanisms of the platform that issues rewards
  to developers for their work.


  Cardstack aims to create an economically-sustainable software ecosystem that avoids the problems of
  today’s centralized platforms. It’s an “experience layer” for the decentralized internet of the future,
  allowing users to combine services across cloud apps and decentralized apps. The ecosystem revolves
  around the use of Cardstack tokens, or CARD.
