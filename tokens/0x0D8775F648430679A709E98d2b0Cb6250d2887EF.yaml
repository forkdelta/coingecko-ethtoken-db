  Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an open-source, decentralized ad exchange platform built on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  platform. Basic Attention Token held an initial coin offering on May 31, 2017 for its eponymous ERC-20
  utility token, raising approximately $35M USD at the time in less than 30 seconds. The Basic Attention
  Token aims to fix digital advertising, which is broken, fraudulent and opaque.


  Basic Attention Token work by having advertisers pay BAT to website publishers for the attention of
  users. The BAT token is designed to correctly value and price user attention within the platform. The
  Basic Attention Token comprises various components, including attention measurement systems, analytics
  dashboards and machine learning algorithms. Integration of BAT into a given host application involves
  implementing BAT Ads, a system that matches and displays ads to users based on locally stored data.
  Ad targeting is performed wholly on-device, removing the need for third-party tracking. BAT is focused
  on the Brave browser. Brave is an open-source, privacy-centered browser designed to block trackers and
  malware. It utilizes blockchain technology to anonymously and securely track user attention, which translates
  into rewards for publishers.


  A user's attention, meaning his or her focused mental engagement on digital content like advertisements,
  is logged through Brave. The makers of BAT indicate that the user's private data and tracking information
  is stored only on the user's device, ensuring that it is anonymous and private.


  Created back in 2016, the Basic Attention Token has one of the biggest names behind it, that of Brendan
  Eich, the creator of JavaScript and the legendary co-founder of Mozilla. Other noteworthy team members
  include Brian Bondy, lead developer and co-founder of Brave and Scott Locklin, senior engineer, and
  co-founder of Kerf Software."


  Basic Attention Token is created by the team that built the <a href="https://brave.com/coi600">Brave
  browser</a>, an open-source, privacy-focused browser that blocks ads and trackers. The browser measures
  user attention and rewards publishers for users attention.
