description: >-
  LITEX is a completely decentralized cryptocurrency payment ecosystem. Based on the business model of
  Epro's payment star product, “Non-bank card payment” and the BOLT protocol, the LITEX team designed
  the LTXN (LITEX Network) to enable the purchaser to pay the legal currency to the merchants and consumers.
  The process by which the purchaser pays back the cryptocurrency. This process is secured by smart contracts
  and does not require the involvement of a centralized operations organization.


  In the LITEX architecture, the upper layer is matched by the decision network to the consumer's payment
  request and the purchaser's purchase request, and the lower layer is established by the lightning network
  to establish a safe and efficient payment channel to pass the cryptocurrency, and the merchant completes
  the purchaser through the acquirer. Consumers pay for the settlement of legal currency. The upper-level
  decision-making network also suppresses the centralization tendency of the lightning network while improving
  network efficiency through incentives and other strategies.
