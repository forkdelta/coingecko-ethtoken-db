description: >-
  The FFF is a five-member meta-index, providing significant exposure to the two largest crypto-assets
  currently in existence, (in the form of 20% WETH, 20% WBTC), while also receiving passively managed
  exposure to:


  * A heavily concentrated, large-cap decentralised finance index (DEFI5),

  * A medium-large-cap index covering significant Ethereum protocols (CC10), and

  * A smaller, riskier index of growth bets across Ethereum (DEGEN)


  The result is an ETF with a 40% focus on 'pure' crypto assets (the ones you know from the news), approximately
  40% covering large/medium-cap DeFi protocols, and the remainder as smaller shots with a greater chance
  of upside, to be phased out in favour of a yield-bearing component in due time.
