  Klee Kai is a community-focused decentralized transaction network. That means that KleeKai is fully
  decentralized and owned by its fun, vibrant community.


  We welcome and embrace diverse perspectives to build Klee Kai in to the best community in crypto.

  Klee Kai is born as a fair-launch, so, clearly, there are no “team tokens”.

  The dev and his team bought $KLEE on the open-market, they are investors just like everybody.


  Our aim is not only to give life to a “memecoin”, we are also working hard to

  make $KLEE a potential coin with an actual value. This is why we decided to integrate a redistribution
  mechanism: all the holders are constantly earning thanks to the 2% reward

  of every single buy or sell transaction.
