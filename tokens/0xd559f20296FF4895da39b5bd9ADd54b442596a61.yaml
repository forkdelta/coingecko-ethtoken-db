description: >-
  Getting an unsecured loan can be easy, fast, and affordable with FintruXâ€™s ecosystem of rated agencies,
  decentralized technology and revolutionary credit enhancements.   Cost reduction is one of the most
  important motivations in securitization. It is often done via credit enhancement.  We can apply the
  same principles to reduce the interest rate required by unsecured loans, making it attractive to both
  borrowers and lenders. Our goal at FintruX Network is to disrupt the way unsecured loans are being originated
  and administered.
