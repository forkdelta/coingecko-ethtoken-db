  ODEM, or On-Demand Education Marketplace, is a blockchain-based distributed network that allows university
  students to seamlessly interact with their professors and academic partners. Through the creation of
  nuanced digital channels, ODEM makes it possible for users to come together to raise the quality of
  accessible education at a reasonable cost. Additionally, the ODEM platform allows qualified and trusted
  individuals from across the global education scene to create customized curriculum that can help students
  gain practical knowledge about the market at large and allow them to gain hands-on experience within
  various industrial sectors. Not only that, ODEM provides students with more choices for housing, transportation,
  and other necessities, thereby allowing international as well as local students to take ownership of
  their educations.


  ODEM connects students with various educational hubs via a smart contract-based payment platform. As
  a result, academic scholars can interact directly with one another and participate in the exchange of
  education and learning, without the involvement of intermediaries. This service allows users to access
  custom-designed courses and educational programs that can help them find a curriculum that meets their
  particular needs. Unlike the educational model used by online service providers such as Coursera and
  Khan Academy, where all teacher-student interaction is maintained virtually, ODEM creates customized
  in-person educational programs that prepare students for real-world jobs and businesses. According to
  the official whitepaper, the majority of ODEM’s current offerings are onsite educational experiences.


  Richard Maaghul is the CEO of this venture. He has been in the startup domain for over two decades and
  has been involved with a number of emerging/disruptive technologies in the past. In addition to co-founding
  ODEM.IO, Rich has been involved with Chevron Corporation as an executive. William Bayrd II is the COO
  of this project. According to his LinkedIn profile, Bill is the founder of three companies, including
  big-name establishments such as Excelorators Inc. Bill possesses a D.Pharma from the University of Tennessee
  Health Science Center. Michael Zargham is the Chief Backend Engineer for ODEM. He holds a Ph.D in Systems
  Engineering with a specialization in decentralized systems. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Michael
  possesses more than a decade’s worth of experience in domains such as digital systems and disruptive
  technology.


  To invest in this company, we will have to buy its ODEM tokens. They are ERC20 <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>-based
  tokens which can be used on the educational platform to trade for educational services. You will be
  able to buy the ODEM tokens during the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/odem">Initial Coin
  Offering (ICO)</a> as the pre-sale was already finished in December 2017. The sale will begin on February
  17 and it will last until March 19. We will be able to use ETH to buy the tokens and you can store them
  in any Ethereum wallet. The tokens will be distributed as soon as the sale is finished.
