description: >-
  GoldenRatio Token (GRT) project is an experiment which has no funding, to prove the importance of a
  quality community in a crypto related project.


  Our goal is to create value into the project which will flow back into the crypto community benefiting
  other projects. Therefore our supply will be distributed among active people contributing to the global
  crypto community.


  The experiment is also aimed to be established as a viable project within 90 days. We aim to achieve
  this by creating several mechanisms and use cases.


  Everything will be given away to the people who are already building the crypto economy.


  All the GoldenRatio Tokens (GRT) will be given away to active contributors of any other high quality
  crypto related projects.
