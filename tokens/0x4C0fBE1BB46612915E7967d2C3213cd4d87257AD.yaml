  APIS can be thought of as a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=41&view=market">masternode</a>
  mediation platform that enables a wide array of crypto enthusiasts to gain access to a two-tier incentivized
  network, also known as the Masternode Network.


  As readers may know, the term “masternodes” refers to the nodes contained in a crypto network that fulfill
  a specific function beyond simply relaying transactions. The most striking feature of a masternode is
  its ability to help investors to acquire stable profits by virtue of simply locking up their holdings
  in the masternode for a fixed amount of time.


  While this may sound like a lucrative proposition, it should be clearly understood that hosting a masternode
  is out of reach for the average investor since it requires a substantial amount of financial capital
  and technical prowess.


  APIS, also sometimes referred to as APIS Core, has been designed atop the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  public blockchain and serves as a masternode mediation platform that aims to help individual and corporate
  investors utilize their assets with desired masternodes easily and effectively.

  The platform can be accessed via a host of digital mediums including PCs, laptops, and smartphones,
  allowing users to maximize their overall profits while on the move.
