  What is SWISS ?

  • SWISS is a farming protocol implementing liquidity and price arbitrages features in its own ecosystem
  thanks to new concepts such as Proof of Volume.


  How does it work ?

  • SWISS allows users to farm while the protocol arbitrates in price and liquidity for the ecosystem
  to grow making it not only a deflationary farming platform but also delivering an exponential growth
  to the ecosystem.


  What is the added value for users ?

  • Each time a user buys or sells SWISS, 3% is withdrawn in the form of SWISS and put back into two wallets
  (2% and 1%) that arbitrages automatically thanks to a code.
