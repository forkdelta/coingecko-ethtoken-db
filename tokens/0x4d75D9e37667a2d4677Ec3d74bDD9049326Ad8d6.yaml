  NFT Wars is a revolutionary new Blockchain game and collectables system utilizing both the Ethereum
  and (soon) Polygon projects to provide a smooth, as well as fast gameplay. It will also become affordable
  once Matic is added. Not only will users be able to collect cards to use as avatars in-game, they will
  also be able to collect rare, shiny cards, and wager them in battle.
