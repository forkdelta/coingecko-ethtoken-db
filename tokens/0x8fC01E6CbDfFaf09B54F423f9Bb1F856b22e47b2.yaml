  ObitanChain aims to solve a wide range of the current problems of IoT networks in terms of data security,
  data circulation, data sharing and data transactions, thus enhancing the efficiency of the whole IoT
  ecosystem. ObitanChain introduces the concept of “lastic sharding at layer one” which facilitates the
  integration of IoT devices with the ObitanChain blockchain network. With the use of Edge Computing technology,
  it enables every device on the IoT network to be utilized as a mining achine, making every IoT device
  that uses ObitanChain subject to mining rewards. Owing to the use of blockchain technology, the data
  source will always be reliable and verifiable on the ObitanChain network.

  Furthermore, the value of the data is quantified and data transfers are fast and secured. This makes
  it easier for IoT standards to emerge, unlocks a plethora of new IoT application scenarios and boosts
  the whole industry to enter the next level of development.
