  MASK is a NFT based index fund backed by Hashmasks and created by NFTX as one of its D1 funds.


  NFTX is a protocol for Non-Fungible Token (NFT) index funds that are built on Ethereum. 


  There are two types of funds on NFTX:


  D1 funds - Every D1 fund token has a 1:1 backing against a NFT. For example, if a user owns 2 PUNK-ZOMBIE,
  that means the user can redeem exactly two random zombie CryptoPunks at any moment.


  D2 funds - Every D2 fund token is a Balancer pool's Liquidity Provider token that has exposure to several
  D1 funds’ token. For example, PUNK is a D2 fund that combines five different D1 Punk funds (PUNK-ZOMBIE,
  PUNK-FEMALE, PUNK-BASIC, PUNK-ATTR-4, & PUNK-ATTR-5).
