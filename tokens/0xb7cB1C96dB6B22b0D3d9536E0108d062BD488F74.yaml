  Waltonchain is a genuine, trustworthy and traceable business ecosystem with complete data sharing and
  absolute information transparency. It is created by the combination of technologies of RFID and blockchain,
  which push forwards the integration of block chain and the Internet of Things.


  Waltonchain combines blockchain with IoT (specifically RFID) to create a management system for supply
  chains. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of RFID technology and a pioneer in
  the space. Logistics systems are complex and commonly involve several different parties. As these systems
  grow, it becomes increasingly tough for businesses in the same vertical to coordinate with each other.
  On top of that, individual entities may have different processes that further hinder the ability to
  transfer data back and forth. Waltonchain uses RFID identification to track products during each step
  of production and distribution.


  The data associated with each item is stored on an immutable blockchain that ensures its accuracy no
  matter where in the process it is.The Waltonchain team is loaded with supply chain experience. Do Sanghyuk,
  one of the co-founders, was previously the Director of the Korean Standard Products Association. The
  other co-founder, Xu Fangcheng was the Supply Chain Management Director of Septwolves Group Ltd. The
  team is getting support from their Chief Scientist Advisor, Kim Sukku – a former vice president of Samsung.
  Waltonchain has no shortage of partnerships – several of which are with Chinese provincial governments.
  The team is working with the Fujian government to create a “smart maritime” blockchain incubator, and
  with the Jinhu government to build smart air purification and monitoring systems.


  The Waltonchain architecture makes use of a novel consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake & Trust
  (PoST). Waltonchain innovates on the traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) model and integrates a node reputation
  based system into the consensus mechanism. PoST provides for adjustable difficulty for each node, to
  ensure that integrity in the ecosystem is rewarded. Waltonchain also gives sub-chain developers the
  option to choose their own consensus mechanism, for example, sub-chains can strictly just have PoS as
  a consensus mechanism, and not PoST. Waltonchain, by use of its RFID technology, has introduced a novel
  way with which blockchain can solve not only the inefficiencies found with supply chain management,
  but also IoT.
