description: >-
  LQTY is a token that captures the fee revenue generated by the Liquity Protocol via staking. Liquity
  is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as
  collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.


  In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow
  borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.


  Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.
