description: >-
  The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of BitMax (BTMX) is a major component of
  the ecosystem on BitMax, and is designed to be used solely as the primary token on the platform. BTMX
  will initially be issued by the Distributor as ERC-20 standard compliant digital tokens on the Ethereum
  blockchain.


  BTMX is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the unit of exchange between
  participants on BitMax. The goal of introducing BTMX is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment
  and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on BitMax. BTMX does not in any
  way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Foundation, the Distributor
  its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor will BMAX entitle token holders
  to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute
  securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction. BTMX may only be utilised on BitMax, and ownership
  of BTMX carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to use BTMX as a means to enable
  usage of and interaction within BitMax.


  BTMX would also function as the economic incentive to incentivise users to participate in the BitMax
  ecosystem. Users of BitMax and/or holders of BTMX which did not actively participate will not receive
  any BTMX incentives.


  The Distributor which issues and sells BTMX shall be an affiliate of the Foundation. The limit of 10
  billion BMAX is strictly imposed without any further increase.


  The users can obtain BTMX through the "Trading Mining" model and are eligible to receive BTMX incentives
  based on the trade volume of their user account. BTMX can also be purchased on the exchange under the
  pairs of BTMX /BTC, BTMX /USDT.
