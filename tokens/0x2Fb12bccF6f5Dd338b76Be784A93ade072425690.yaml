  BEAT strives to disrupt the health and sports industry by unleashing the value of a health and sports
  data using cutting-edge blockchain technology.


  The BEAT Blockchain will enable the user to store his verified sports health and activity data anonymously
  and encrypted in the Blockchain. The user can decide if he wants to become a Data Provider by sharing
  specific data based on a contractual agreement with future Data Consumers.


  The Data Consumer only gets access to the data as agreed in the contract and for the sole purpose defined
  in the contract. In return, these Data Consumers - who are usually fitness providers like gyms and sports
  equipment manufacturers - will provide their products and services at a discounted rate, or even for
  free.
