  Donuts are a form of community points that are (currently) exclusive to the r/ethtrader subreddit. You
  can think of them as similar to Reddit karma, except exclusively representing contributions on r/ethtrader,
  rather than all of Reddit.


  You can also directly give Donuts to other users as a reward for good comments. Once you have Donuts,
  give it a try! While using the new Reddit redesign, click on the Donut symbol next to any username to
  give that user some of your Donuts.


  Donuts use cases currently include tipping other users' posts and comments, adding weight to your votes
  in governance polls, buying limited-edition subreddit badges, and buying the banner to probably update
  it with whatever weird t-shirt Vitalik wore to the last development conference.


  You can also turn any amount of your Reddit Donuts into an ERC-20 cryptocurrency token at a 1:1 rate,
  and vice versa.


  Converting EthTrader Donuts To ERC-20 Donuts

  Step 1: Deposit donuts into your donut.dance account.


  To make a deposit from Reddit, send donuts to ProofOfDonut. Any donuts received will be deposited to
  your account.


  To send donuts, go to https://new.reddit.com/r/ethtrader (this ensures you are using the Reddit redesign).
  Find the side module labelled "Subreddit Points", click on the "Send" button, enter the number of donuts
  you would like to deposit, and send them to ProofOfDonut.

  Now when you visit donut.dance and log in using your Reddit account, you will see your balance reflects
  the number of donuts you have deposited.




  Step 2: Withdraw ERC-20 Donuts


  After depositing donuts to donut.dance, you can convert them into ERC-20 tokens by going to https://donut.dance/withdraw
  and entering an Ethereum address and an amount of donuts to withdraw. Click the "Withdraw" button, and
  ERC-20 donuts will be sent to your Ethereum address!
