  TrueUSD provides its token holders regular attestations of escrowed balances, full collateral, and also
  the legal protection against misappropriating underlying USD. The team believes that TrueUSD will be
  able to come up with the stable trading instrument for the traders of cryptocurrency that has been long-awaited.
  This will allow the businesses and consumers to use the digital currency as a medium of an exchange.
  The goal of the TrueUSD team was to build a coin that is stable and which can be used and trusted by
  them too. TrustToken is a platform that creates the tokens backed by assets that can easily be purchased
  and sold all around the world. The first asset token of TrustToken is TrueUSD, which is a stable coin
  and can be redeemed 1-for-1 for US dollars. TrustToken have partnered with registered fiduciaries and
  banks for holding the funds securely backed by TrueUSD tokens. To increase the amount of security, fiduciaries,
  and banks directly handle all the funds. Escrowed funds do not give access to the TrueUSD system.


  TrueUSD works with various trust companies which already manage around billions of dollars. Just pass
  an AML/KYC check, send USD to a trust company with an agreement of escrow. When the funds get verified,
  their API tells the smart contract of TUSD to mint an equal amount of TUSD to your public <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  address.


  The USD funds are regularly verified in scheduled attestations by a very much trusted auditing firm.
  USD funds are kept safely in a third party account, that is escrow accounts, wherein TrustToken does
  not hold any direct access to the funds and cannot abscond with them even if they wish to. The token
  burning and minting system makes sure that every TUSD token is backed by 1 USD.


  A mandatory check of AML/KYC makes sure that TUSD keeps shady people away from the entire project. TUSD
  makes faster transactions in low transaction fees. Even though TUSD is a unique offering, it is most
  likely overshadowed by its bigger competitors - Tether. While TUSD arguably offers more security and
  features, it may be losing the marketing battle. This is not to say that the situation will remain the
  same. With more crypto investors joining the market every day, the good times for TUSD may be on their
  way.
