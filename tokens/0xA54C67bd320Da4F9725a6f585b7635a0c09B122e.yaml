  TimeMiner utilizes a new system called Proof-of-Time. Proof-of-Time is a combination of Proof-of-Work
  and Proof-of-Stake while also incorporating rebasing mechanics. The contract code creates one new coin
  every hour and distributes it to the existing holders according to their current percentage of the circulating
  supply. Every day there will only be 24 coins added to the circulating supply. Added coins are always
  split amongst the existing holders and never dumped by the team onto the market.


  By holding time you will benefit from an hourly rebase, giving you a share of each new TIME, according
  to your percentage of the total supply.

  The supply is exceptionally low. Even after a full year of its existance there will only be 8760 TIME
  in total. At the time of writing this the circulating supply is just around 200 time.
