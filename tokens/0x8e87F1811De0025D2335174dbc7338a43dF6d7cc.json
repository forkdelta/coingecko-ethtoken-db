As a transactional daily currency, VGO aims to provide a scalable and sustainable alternative to Bitcoin. VGO is a Bitcoin Differentiation Project. The algorithm mainly includes SHA256 and RIPEMD160. Bitcoin combines the application of these two hashing algorithms into two functions: hash 256 (d) = sha256 (d) and hash 160 (d) = ripemd160 (sha256 (d). D is an array of bytes to be hashed, which generates 256 bits (32 bytes) and 160 bits (20 bytes) respectively. The hexadecimal value. Hash256 is mainly used to generate identifiers, such as block ID, transaction ID, etc., while hash160 is mainly used to generate VGO addresses. The above algorithm can be mined on any computer, and no special mining equipment is ever needed. VGO can achieve efficient transaction confirmation. And through VVM (VGO Virtual Machine) intelligent contract virtual machine to run intelligent contract coding, provides a faster, more scalable block chain platform, more suitable for daily transactions.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"virtual-goods-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8889/large/1QdEK96k_400x400.png?1562574531","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8889/small/1QdEK96k_400x400.png?1562574531","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8889/thumb/1QdEK96k_400x400.png?1562574531"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8e87f1811de0025d2335174dbc7338a43df6d7cc"],"facebook_username":"vgo.vgo.7186","homepage":["http://vgo.life/"],"twitter_screen_name":"VGO59207631"},"liquidity_score":45.503,"market_cap_rank":5479,"name":"Virtual Goods Token","public_interest_score":40.496,"symbol":"vgo","tickers":[]}
