description: "At the heart of Ubex’s advertising purchasing algorithms, lie neural networks that process\t\
  information about each visitor to the member networks’ websites. The neural networks evaluate the interests\
  \ of users, calculate the likelihood of targeted actions for all advertiser offers, and choose the most\
  \ suitable advertisement. Thanks to this, member network website visitors see only those ads that are\
  \ maximally confined to their interests, and which would convince them to fulfill the target action\
  \ with maximum probability. Thus, Ubex maximizes the targeting of advertising and the economic efficiency\
  \ for advertisers."
