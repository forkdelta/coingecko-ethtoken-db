  DACC – Decentralized Accessible Content – is the first public chain that revolutionize online content
  and media identity and access management (IAM) worldwide.


  As an interactive platform, DAC, through the innovative use of blockchain technology, allows creators
  to control and protect their content, while also giving them a secure and efficient way of selling it
  globally.


  The DAC Platform consists of two separate components: DAC Tokens and DAC Power.

  The most innovative and interesting component of the DAC platform may be the DAC Power system, a reward
  system for those that contribute to the community; DAC Tokens are the native cryptocurrency of the platform.
  These tokens will be distributed to those who contribute to the quality and maintenance of the platform
  and they be exchanged on any crypto market.
