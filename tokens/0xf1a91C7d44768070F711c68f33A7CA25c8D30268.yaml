  Charli3 is the first decentralized oracle being built on Cardano. This allows Charli3 to have all the
  benefits of existing successful oracle protocols, while having the flexibility of a much more agile
  blockchain backbone.


  Charli3 finds a niche within the Cardano ecosystem. By being native to Cardano’s blockchain, it will
  have the lowest barrier to entry for functioning as the standard decentralized oracle of all Cardano
  based projects. The added benefit of being on Cardano’s blockchain includes agility of the network,
  and being in a low transaction fee environment. While these advantages may seem subtle, the growth of
  any decentralized oracle relies on it’s adoption. Charli3 will be the clear choice for any project building
  on the Cardano Blockchain.
