  SelfKey provides organizations and individuals with complete ownership over their own digital identity,
  empowering them to discover additional privacy and freedom. SelfKey is a self-sovereign identity system
  that is based on the blockchain and can provide control and management of digital identities to users.
  Additionally, users can utilize SelfKey to securely manage a crypto portfolio and instantly onboard
  immigration, cryptocurrency, and financial services. One of the unique aspects of SelfKey is its ability
  to work as an all-in-one identity solution for self-sovereignty. SelfKey utilizes a novel approach to
  identity management while also resolving the issues related to existing centralized identity management
  systems. These include the lack of accessibility to financial services and the tedious KYC processes
  that are paper based.


  One of the standout features of SelfKey is the self-hosted data storage. This lets you secure your identity
  documents and assets locally, so there is no risk of a major data breach as with other similar systems.
  The KYC processes within SelfKey also stand out for their efficiency. Qualified certifiers can provide
  you with reusable identity authentication upon request. You can then share this authentication multiple
  times with several service providers. This, in turn, prevents you from wasting time and effort with
  a traditional KYC onboarding process that is typically tedious. SelfKey additional minimizes data because
  of its blockchain-based verifiable claims protocol. This protocol lets you as an identity owner prove
  you meet the ID attributes required for a specific service or product without any need to actually share
  your identity document. In other words, you can provide proof of your ID without sharing the ID, keeping
  the data you send to a minimum. Of course, SelfKey also provides the full functionality you want from
  a cryptocurrency wallet, including the ability to securely manage cryptocurrency assets like ETH, KEY,
  and the other ERC-20 tokens.Edmund Lowell is the founder of SelfKey.


  On his LinkedIn page, Edmund describes himself as an entrepreneur whose “skill sets lie at the crossroads
  of finance, technology, and law/regulations.” Additionally, he has been involved with other projects
  related to personal data protection, self-sovereign digital identity systems, blockchains, and distributed
  ledgers. Terry Lin is the product manager for this venture. In the past, Terry has been associated with
  many established projects including, AMZ Tracker, UBS and Build My Online Store. Lastly, Ari Propis
  is the accounting backbone of SelfKey. He has been in the crypto domain for more than five years and
  has previously worked as a consultant for various blockchain and international accounting startups.
  It was introduced into the market earlier this year, KEY tokens were initially traded at a modest price
  of US$0.08 per token.
