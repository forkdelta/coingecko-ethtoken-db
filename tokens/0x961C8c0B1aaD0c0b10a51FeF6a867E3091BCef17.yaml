  Why is DeFi Yield Protocol Unique? DeFi Yield Protocol: Your New On-The-Go DeFi


  DeFi Yield Protocol (DYP) will provide a solution to the risk Yield Farming brought in. How? – The DYP
  is developing a platform that allows anyone to provide liquidity and to be rewarded for the first time
  with Ethereum. At the same time, the platform maintains both token price stability as well as secure
  and simplified for end users by integrating a DYP anti-manipulation feature.


  How will this work?


  DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) is changing the way you earn through liquidity on Ethereum smart contract.
  The argument is that whales have the power to control the network. DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) prevents
  the whale advantage. DYP anti-manipulation feature ensures that all pool (DYP/ETH, DYP/USDC, DYP/USDT,
  and DYP/WBTC POOL) rewards are automatically converted from DYP to ETH at 00:00 UTC, and the system
  automatically distributes the rewards to the liquidity providers. This feature is excellent because
  the network’s liquidity will be fair to all participants; no whale will be able to manipulate the price
  of DYP to their advantage.


  Every day at 00:00 UTC, the smart contract will automatically try to convert the DYP rewards to ETH.
  If the DYP price is affected by more than -2.5%, then the maximum DYP amount that does not affect the
  price will be swapped to ETH, with the remaining amount distributed in the next day’s rewards. After
  seven days, if there are still undistributed DYP rewards, the DeFi Yield protocol (DYP) governance will
  vote on whether the remaining DYP will be distributed to the token holders or burned (all burned tokens
  are removed from circulation).


  Smart contracts are the engine room of any related project. The advantage of smart contracts is that
  the community writes the rules; they can work without human interaction. Unlike the centralized world
  in which a set of rules are interpreted by a few experts who make decisions. Cool feature, Right. Not
  really. There is a significant disadvantage of smart contract risk, which happens when there is a bug
  in a smart contract. YAM finance is the greatest example of a smart contract risk. The team discovered
  a bug that prevented a vote from being executed. Yam tokens were dumped by users causing the tokens
  to plunge overnight. DYP prevents smart contract risk by ensuring that all their smart contracts are
  audited, and the codes are secured from participants who try to take advantage of the system.
