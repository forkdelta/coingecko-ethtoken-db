description: "What Is Truebit (TRU)?\n\nFounded in 2016, Truebit is a blockchain protocol that brings\
  \ decentralized off-chain execution power to the blockchain. Rather than relying on external, cryptographic\
  \ proofs of correctness, Truebit leverages game theoretic principles to effectively increase the on-chain\
  \ computation power of existing networks and reduce marginal gas costs.\n\nThrough a novel incentive\
  \ structure and architecture, the Truebit protocol allows trustless, secure and scalable consensus on\
  \ large computations beyond whatâ€™s possible on Ethereum today and in easy to use programming languages.\
  \ More than a scalability solution, Truebit is a unanimous form of consensus that can trustlessly grab\
  \ data across external sources, including other blockchains and uses a retrofitting oracle to connect\
  \ to the outside world.  \n\nAiming to be one of the building blocks for the future of decentralized\
  \ computing, Truebit's open source community and vision enable a scalable computation solution open\
  \ to all."
