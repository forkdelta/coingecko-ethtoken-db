description: "What Is Truebit (TRU)?\n\nFounded in 2017, the Truebit protocol brings revolutionary off-chain\
  \ execution power to the blockchain.  Rather than relying on external, cryptographic proofs of correctness,\
  \ Truebit leverages game theoretic principles to effectively increase the on-chain computation power\
  \ of existing networks.\n\nThrough a novel incentive structure and architecture, the Truebit protocol\
  \ allows trustless, secure, scalable consensus on large computations orders of magnitude beyond what’s\
  \ possible on Ethereum today and in easy to use programming languages.  TrueBit is more than a scalability\
  \ solution for Ethereum.  It’s a unanimous form of consensus that can trustlessly grab data across external\
  \ sources, including other blockchains and uses a retrofitting oracle to connect to the outside world.\
  \  \n\nAs one of the critical building blocks for the future of decentralized computing, Truebit's open\
  \ source community and vision enable a seamless computational scalability solution on the blockchain,\
  \ making machine learning and AI available to everyone.\n\nWhile smart contracts can perform small computations\
  \ correctly, large computation tasks pose security risks for blockchains due to the Verifier's Dilemma.\
  \  Truebit counteracts this shortcoming via a trustless, retrofitting oracle which achieves correct\
  \ computational results.  Any smart contract can issue a computation task to this oracle in the form\
  \ of WebAssembly bytecode, while anonymous “miners” receive rewards for correctly solving the task.\n\
  \nThe oracle’s protocol guarantees correctness in two layers: a unanimous consensus layer where anyone\
  \ can object to faulty solutions, and an on-chain mechanism which incentivizes participation and ensures\
  \ fair remuneration. These components formally manifest themselves through a combination of novel, off-chain\
  \ architecture and on-chain smart contracts.\n\nWho are the founders of Truebit (TRU)?\n\nTruebit was\
  \ founded by Jason Teutsch (Truebit Establishment), with significant contributions from Christian Reitweissner\
  \ (Ethereum Foundation). Jason has a PhD in Mathematics and was a Fulbright Fellow to Israel and Hungary.\
  \  Christian has a PhD in Computational Complexity and is the creator of the Ethereum smart contract\
  \ language Solidity, which powers the Ethereum virtual machine behind every smart contract and DApp\
  \ (decentralized application) running on the Ethereum network. \n\nWhat makes Truebit (TRU) unique?\n\
  \nBitcoin and Ethereum, whose miners arguably collectively comprise the most powerful computational\
  \ resource in the history of mankind, offer no more power for processing and verifying transactions\
  \ than a typical smart phone.  Truebit bypasses this bottleneck and brings scalable computation to Ethereum\
  \ and all blockchains with a financial incentive layer atop a dispute resolution layer where the latter\
  \ takes form of a versatile “verification game.” In addition to secure outsourced computation, immediate\
  \ applications include decentralized mining pools whose operator is an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency\
  \ with scalable transaction throughput, and a trustless means for transferring currency between disjoint\
  \ cryptocurrency systems.\n\nWhat kind of token is Truebit (TRU)?\n\nTruebit is a net inflationary token,\
  \ which is similar to Ethereum. TRU tokens are created and destroyed over time according to cumulative\
  \ demand. Each Truebit task burns TRU tokens. Users can purchase or retire TRU tokens in exchange for\
  \ ETH. Each purchase transaction deposits some ETH into a reserve escrow (the rest goes to the Company),\
  \ and some ETH is withdrawn from the reserve through each retire transaction."
