  Kencoin is an industry-specific cryptocurrency, targeting the adult entertainment sector. Their mission
  is to serve as the standard currency for anonymous, safe transactions in all sex and dating-related
  purchases. Users’ desire to preserve absolute privacy creates major hurdles for businesses in the adult
  sector. Many prospective customers visit websites that fulfill their fantasies, only to drop out of
  the signup/payment process at the moment the website asks for personal or financial details. Thus, owners
  of adult websites lose a significant amount of business every day, simply because their users lack a
  safe, anonymous way to pay for the content they want. Kencoin solves this problem in one stroke, with
  a completely anonymous cryptocurrency that leverages blockchain technology to provide users with anonymity,
  privacy and secured transactions, while delivering previously unreachable alpha to adult industry merchants.
