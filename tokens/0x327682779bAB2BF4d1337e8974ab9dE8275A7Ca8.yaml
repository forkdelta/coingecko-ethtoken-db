description: >-
  The complex crypto space makes it difficult for beginners to start trading. Current platforms impose
  high barriers to entry, because they often lack usability, transparency and education. As a result,
  many people are discouraged to adopt the crypto economy.


  We are building a user-friendly crypto exchange that combines social trading with a hybrid-decentralized
  architecture to help people safely trade crypto assets. We bridge the gap between the crypto economy
  and the traditional world of finance to shift towards a digital and decentralized society.
