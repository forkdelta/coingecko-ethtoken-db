description: >-
  CX is a hyper-deflationary self-governing ERC20 token with inbuilt mechanisms

  to automatically burn 4% of the total supply and apply a 5% tax upon each transaction.


  The inbuilt burn mechanism provides an immediate deflation of 4% each time the token is swapped or transferred
  causing the value of FCX to increase over time autonomously. Additionally, the 5% tax applied to each
  transaction is redistributed amongst holders of the token and provides an automatic yield generation
  without requiring any gas fees for the balance to be updated in token holdersâ€™ wallets.


  Ultimately, FCX builds on and improves the RFI framework by increasing the tax (and therefore the reward
  to holders) by a factor of 5, whilst also providing a 4% deflationary burn mechanic of which RFI lacks.
