description: >-
  CPUcoin is a decentralized Infrastructure-as-a-Service solution that drastically reduces cloud infrastructure
  costs by creating a new sharing economy for unused CPU/GPU power. Their technology enables anyone to
  install a miner client and collect funds for their unused computing time, essentially transforming the
  project into a sort of Airbnb for CPU/GPU computing resources as well as providing a platform for automatically
  deploying and scaling Decentralized Services and DApps.


  A new certified utility token called CPU Coin will enable organizations of all sizes to pay as they
  go, a highly convenient feature that is not yet available in the market.
