  Sirin Labs Token is a crypto token developed by blockchain development company Sirin Labs, and is a
  part of the SIRIN Labs ecosystem. Sirin Labs has been developing the first blockchain smartphone, and
  every product of this company is committed to using their own blockchain! They promote use of digital
  currencies and decentralization through SRN tokens.


  Sirin Labs was found in 2014. Solarin was their first project, which gained popularity as the most secure
  phone in the world. Though it was a success and was endorsed by famous celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio,
  the company declared a layoff of about one-third of the staff by 2015. The reason they announced was
  developments in other fields. In late 2017, Sirin Labs announced the ICO (Initial Public Offering) of
  Sirin Lab Token (SRN) in order to give their operations a new direction. Now, they focus on bringing
  new technology for mass adoption.


  SIRIN Labs has a vision of creating open source and secure devices for mass adoption. The biggest problem
  SRN tokens face is convincing average users of smartphone that a high security phone is worth investing
  in! If SRN tokens follow the recent trends and other products by SIRIN Labs become a success, then that
  day is not away when SRN token will be one of the top cryptocurrencies in the world. SRN tokens have
  immense potential for development. Given that the smartphone market is one of their targets, there’s
  a large industry that’s being picked on as an audience for the technology.
