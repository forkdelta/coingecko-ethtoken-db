description: >-
  10set token has been launched in January 2021, using Ethereum erc20 protocol.


  It's a new generation etf 2.0 deflationary token with a smart staking system, that bridges cryptocurrencies
  with the stock market. Tenset adds a 2% transaction fee to every transfer.


  Half of the fee is burned creating a deflationary effect and another half is automatically distributed
  to all token holders. No need to freeze it or hold it any special wallet.
