description: >-
  RenaSwap is a one-sided automated market maker-based decentralized token swap protocol which utilizes
  token wrappers, buy-only liquidity pairs, and circulating asset flows to amplify volume for all tokens
  integrated with RenaSwap. We call this Volume Aggregation as it gives new life to all participating
  projects in the form of increased volume, which attracts more liquidity, increasing incentives for Liquidity
  Providers. Its specialized design utilizes RENA, our deflationary ERC-20 utility token, to tap into
  the numerous capital flows moving through interoperating DEXs and share a percentage of those flows
  with ETH/RENA liquidity providers.
