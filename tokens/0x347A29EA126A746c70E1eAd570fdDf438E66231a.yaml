  CurrentCoin is an Ethereum-based token that will allow users from across the world to deploy software,
  buy from marketplaces, and create customized software solutions. We believe digital services should
  be as simple as clicking a button; through our Ethereum-based solution, we're making that happen.

  We have deep experience in the space, through cryptocurrency companies and San Francisco startups, for
  a combined background going back decades; now that we've completed our ICO, we're looking to expand
  now to the world.
