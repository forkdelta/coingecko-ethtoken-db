  Holochain enables a distributed web with user autonomy built directly into its architecture and protocols.
  Data is about remembering our lived and shared experiences. Distributing the storage and processing
  of that data can change how we coordinate and interact. With digital integration under user control,
  Holochain liberates our online lives from corporate control over our choices and information.


  Holochain is an energy efficient post-blockchain ledger system and decentralized application platform
  that uses peer-to-peer networking for processing agent centric agreement and consensus systems between
  users.


  Holochain enables any device to have its own chain based ledger system. By using a holographic model
  for data storage and transfer developers can now create decentralized applications that can scale in
  multiple dimensions across a network ensuring they are truly distributed. This enables every device
  on a network to function independently, and only requires the synchronization of data when necessary,
  or agreed upon by users. This means every user is in control of their own data, and never has to risk
  their data being sold or exposed to 3rd parties like what just happened with Facebook and Cambridge
  Analytica.


  Holochain provides a framework for developers to build decentralized applications and aims to change
  the paradigm of data-centric blockchains to an agent-centric system. In Holochain’s fledgling system,
  no true global consensus is maintained. Instead, each agent in the public blockchain maintains a private
  fork, essentially, that is managed and stored in a limited way on the public blockchain with a distributed
  hash table. This means there are no scalability limits and dapps hosted on Holochain can do much more
  with less of nearly everything than traditional blockchains.


  This system however has some inherent weaknesses. Because the entire blockchain must be verified by
  each member of the network, scalability problems quickly develop. The larger the amount of data being
  handled, the more restrictive the limit of transactions per second that can occur on the blockchain
  at any one time.Holochain itself is open source and written in Go. Go was selected for its ease of use
  and similarity to C. Dapps written specifically for Holochain can be developed with JavaScript or Lisp,
  with support for front-end systems using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.


  The developers added that Holochain is relatively flexible when it comes to handling new languages,
  so there is potential for growth on that front. Holochain bills itself as an environmentally friendly
  alternative to traditional blockchains. Because there is no need for each individual agent to store
  and validate the global blockchain, Holochain only consumes a fraction of the bandwidth of traditional
  chains. Holochain also does not have a mining component, so there’s no electricity or processing power
  spent on proof-of-work calculations.


  Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun are the co-founders of Holochain and creators of Holochain. They
  have been designing alternatives currencies since the 80’s and have been working on Holu since before
  the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> whitepaper was written. To protect
  the incentives of users, founders and developers, Holochain is owned by a non-profit foundation. he
  company’s advisory team also includes Ryan Bubinski, the co-founder of CodeAcademy. In June, Holochain
  announced a new strategic partnership with Promether, an Adaptive Symbiotic Platform (ASP) that implements
  all the networking, security and anonymization code applications need to protect their data.
