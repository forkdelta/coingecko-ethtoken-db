description: "CoinPoker is a worldwide cryptocurrency-based online poker room that’s launching its ICO\
  \ this November. We’re operating with Ethereum Smart Contracts and once the room will have been launched,\
  \ we’re going to ensure full transparency via the use of blockchains. The RNG will be visible on blockchains,\
  \ and the players will be able to see it after the game. That together with the pain-free transactions\
  \ thanks to cryptocurrency will solve many of the problems that online poker has been facing. •\tTransactions\
  \ will be immediate + accessible worldwide; •\tRnG will be visible for transparency; •\tAnonymity will\
  \ be guaranteed; •\tFair play at the tables will be ensured. + HUGE Grand Opening Events with awesome\
  \ prizes (15% of tokens distributed during the ICO will be returned during these tournaments). What\
  \ makes us different from other ICOs? Well, for one, we’ve got our MVP (minimum viable product, in our\
  \ case – an app) ready to go, and we’ll be launching our MVP with play money before our actual ICO start!"
