description: >-
  The Phoenix DAO foundation is launching a new token (PHNX) that is forked from an existing open-source
  community driven project, Hydro Blockchain (formally known as Project Hydro). Phoenix DAO solves the
  centralized issues at the core of the original Hydro project with a community built DAO, a healthier
  token distribution plan with built-in smart contracts, added use cases, and an updated token supply.
  The PHNX ecosystem includes the following protocols; Authentication, Identity, Payments, Storage, Tokenization
  which will be the backbone of the ecosystem fuelling the dApp Store and an Events Marketplace
