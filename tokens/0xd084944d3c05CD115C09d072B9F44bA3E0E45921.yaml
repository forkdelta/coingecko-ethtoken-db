  Manifold Finance provides solutions encompassing the middleware market for decentralized finance applications
  and protocols for both scaling and usability purposes. Part of our mission is helping scale the Ethereum
  ecosystem, which is where the idea of ‘middleware strategies’ comes into play. Our solutions can be
  thought of as an ‘APY strategy’ that you might find with something like Yearn Finance, except instead
  of providing capital (e.g. through depositing into a strategy with Yearn), we create applications that
  provide services that generate revenue (a prime example being YCabal).
