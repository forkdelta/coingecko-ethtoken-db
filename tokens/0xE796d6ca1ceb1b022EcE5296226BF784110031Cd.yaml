description: "BLES is the governance token of the Blind Boxes platform. In total, only 100,000,000 $BLES\
  \ will ever be minted. Out of the total supply, a minimum of 50,000,000 $BLES will be reserved for community\
  \ issuance. The primary way to acquire $BLES is by participating in the Blind Boxes ecosystem. For example,\
  \ players mine tokens each time they open a Blind Box. Other ways to acquire $BLES include:\n•\tselling\
  \ NFTs for $BLES\n•\tacquiring $BLES through centralized and decentralized exchanges\n•\treceiving a\
  \ Foundation Grant as a creator\n•\tparticipating in Blind Boxes community events\n\nThe Blind Boxes\
  \ DAO allows BLES token holders to propose features and vote on the development of the platform. Through\
  \ this mechanism, governance issues and key developmental decisions are decided in a distributed, transparent,\
  \ and equitable manner."
