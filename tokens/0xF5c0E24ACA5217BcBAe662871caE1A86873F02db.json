The candle body must close above or below the fractal of the prior period to satisfy the trade trigger condition.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"alligator-fractal-set","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11653/large/alligator_fractal_set.png?1592325151","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11653/small/alligator_fractal_set.png?1592325151","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11653/thumb/alligator_fractal_set.png?1592325151"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/set-protocol"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf5c0e24aca5217bcbae662871cae1a86873f02db"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/x3PGVfP"],"homepage":["https://www.tokensets.com/set/gator"],"twitter_screen_name":"SetProtocol"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Alligator + Fractal Set","public_interest_score":0.016,"symbol":"gator","tickers":[]}
