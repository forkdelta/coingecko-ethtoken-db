  What Is SpaceSwap?


  SpaceSwap is a platform that was launched on 10 September 2020.

  The project aims to create residual income through the best that DeFi has to offer.SpaceSwap introduces
  two significant innovations which have the power to transform DeFi. The team behind the project designed
  its 'Shadow Staking' technology which allows users' LP tokens to remain in their personal wallets while
  their liquidity is in use on partner exchanges, safe from cyber hijack attacks. The tokenomics system
  shared between the SpaceSwap Milk2 (MILK2) token and the SpaceSwap Shake token (SHAKE) creates a financial
  ecosystem that is entirely novel in its kind.

   SpaceSwap tools include:

  Interstellar

  The Interstellar platform allows liquidity providers to add LP tokens to the Milky Planets (farming
  pools). Once users provide their LP tokens, they start to farm MILK2 tokens.

  SHAKE Blender

  This service allows users to exchange SpaceSwap Milk2 for Shake and vice versa.

  Shadow Staking

  Shadow Farming or Shadow Staking is a unique development that will revolutionize the whole DeFi farming
  sector.

  It introduces a brand new way to stake LP tokens. All tokens are kept by the holder, which makes the
  staking process more secure and transparent.

  Index Platform


  [SpaceSwap Index](https://spaceswap.app/index-token) is a platform for buying index tokens (sets of
  tokens) which lowers the investment risks present in the crypto sphere. The platform contains SpaceSwap
  and other company tokens, as well as users' own tokens.

  Bridge

  The SpaceSwap Bridge allows all tokens to migrate across chains. If the liquidity on the SpaceSwap Bridge
  is exhausted, users need to wait until the team burns SpaceSwap Milk2 and Shake on Ethereum and creates
  them on BSC.

  NFT Stars

  Every creator present on NFT STARS will be hand-picked by our team, the criteria will be shared later.
  The SpaceSwap team will help the artists create their NFT collection and will assist them in its promotion.

  NFT Mania

  NFT Mania is the first ever NFT quest based on a fully gamified platform, where one can compete individually
  or as a group to get to the three chests with the final prizes.

  SpaceSwap Starter

  SpaceSwap Starter is a platform that helps to bring high-quality DeFi projects to the public. Stake
  your Milk2 or Shake tokens and get access to launchpad allocations.

  SpaceLend

  SpaceLend is a Decentralized Lending / Borrow protocol. SpaceLend allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies.
  Moreover, the lending protocol allows earning compound interest.
