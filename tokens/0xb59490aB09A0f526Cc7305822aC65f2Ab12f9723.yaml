  Litentry is a network that supports DID aggregation protocol and a decentralized mobile application.


  Litentry Network is built on top of the Substrate framework with the objective of enabling DID aggregation,
  verification, and credit calculation. It aims to simplify the process of resolving agnostic DID mechanisms
  by integrating DID standards into a modularized identity service.


  The Litentry mobile application serves as a secure vehicle for users to collect their decentralized
  identities and manage them in one place.


  LIT token holders are also able to participate in on-chain governance in an efficient and secure manner.
