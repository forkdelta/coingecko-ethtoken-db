description: >-
  Leverj decentralizes the most desirable features of derivatives trading by implementing them in cryptocurrencies
  and eliminating points of friction. With a tight focus on derivatives trading and the supporting ecosystem,
  Leverj has taken the approach of defining the product first. We have built a functioning exchange with
  a usable UI (user interface), decentralized identity, and provable audit. We plan to decentralize the
  back-end and add ecosystem features that will enable large players to move into the cryptocurrency world.
