  Digitex Futures is a commission-free cryptocurrency futures exchange with a rapid-fire one-click trading
  ladder and high leverage. Traders can buy and sell perpetual swap futures contracts on Bitcoin against
  the US Dollar and pay no transaction fees on any trades. The company will be adding extra markets such
  as Ethereum and Litecoin soon after the mainnet launch on April 27.


  Commission-free trading is made possible by using its own cryptocurrency, called the DGTX token, as
  the native currency of the futures exchange. Instead of covering costs by charging transaction fees
  on trades, Digitex meets the operational costs of running the futures exchange by creating and selling
  a small number of new DGTX tokens each year.
