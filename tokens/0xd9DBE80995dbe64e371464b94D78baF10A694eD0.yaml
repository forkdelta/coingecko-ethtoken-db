description: >-
  SAM serves as a tool for long-term evaluation of the company's vision and current value. To preserve
  the value of the company, 62% of the issuance is owned by the company and distributed as our business
  expands. 400,000,000 SAM is currently available in Uzbekistan in comparison with greenhouses and production
  volume. As food production expands, it will be distributed in addition to the size of the business.
  It will be partly supplied to users and preserves their value.


  SAM is also used as a solution to the complex structure of trade remittances. It is responsible for
  financing projects conducted by SAM through alliances with countries and local exchanges, and also serves
  as easy and quick currency to convertibility.
