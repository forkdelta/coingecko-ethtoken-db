  Dogen Finance is a decentralized autonomous organization with the purpose of bringing Doges into DeFi.
  Dogen Finance provides a place for all doge-type tokens to generate yield.

  for doge-type token pairs. DOGEN farmers earn by combining their DOGE-related tokens such as renDOGE,
  SHIB, and AKITA with ETH in Uniswap and staking the resulting pool token in a Dogen Finance dog park
  on the ""Parks"" page.


  Dogen Finance is community-governed and works together to crowdsourced yield generation strategies.
  Based on the model of BadgerDAO, whose purpose is bringing Bitcoin to DeFi, Dogen Finance brings Doges
