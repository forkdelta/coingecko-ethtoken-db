description: >-
  We are a group of crypto traders that feel apprehensive about all the rugpulls and scams and decided
  to make our own memecoin. We have a plan to go short and long term. Our short term plan includes growing
  the token and educating people about how to avoid scams and rugpulls.


  Long term, we want to develop tools to identify particular scam and rug tactics. The goal is to help
  the crypto community at a whole to avoid the bad tokens. Defi is not and should not be about scamming
  money off of people. We want to help put an end to it.
