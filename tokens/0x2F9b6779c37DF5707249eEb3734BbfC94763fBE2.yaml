description: >-
  Our aim is to give investors direct access to investment opportunities in the Crypto world and to enable
  entrepreneurs to raise capital for financing their projects in an efficient, cost effective, and secure
  way. CrowdWiz ecosystem is based on the concept of crowd wisdom, which utilizes the collective opinion
  of a group (the crowd) rather than that of an individual expert. We will use crypto financing (via Initial
  Coin Offering) for raising capital, as an integral part of our growth synergy with the contributors.
  The CrowdWiz ecosystem will be based on cryptographic token called WIZ, a tradeable token with the dual
  purpose of granting investors voting rights and exclusive access to the CrowdWiz ecosystem.
