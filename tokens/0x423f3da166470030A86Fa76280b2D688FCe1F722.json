The combination of digital assets and blockchain cutting-edge technology is expected to change the monopoly\npattern of classical finance. As we all know, the operation of traditional finance is subject to the management of the administrative\nsystem, and these artificially divided worlds have also greatly prevented the effective circulation of value. The way of operation we\nbelieve in is to abandon the present and take a glance at the current world, the current high-cost, centralized, powerful and centralized\nfinancial world, her presentation includes but is not limited to financial activities such as credit creation, debit and credit, payment,\nsecurities underwriting, IPO, etc, which all must be executed by a trusted centralized third-party organization.\nWhile in centralized finance, trust comes from authority and the authorization of centralized agencies. As the authority, the\nadministrative agency controls the pricing power of assets. However, in different administrative regions, the circulation of value is\nmore dependent on the relationship among regions. In terms of specific presentation, individuals must rely on their own labor to obtain\nequivalents recognized by the administrative agencies, i.e, assets, and these assets will change in value with the fluctuation of the\nadministrative agency. From the perspective of liquidity, the circulation of assets must rely on the traditional financial channel, which\nlead to huge losses in it.\nSince the creation of Bitcoin, the greatest achievement of digital currency or blockchain is the realization of value transmission on the\nnetwork under the premise of minimizing trust. It eliminates the bottleneck of capital flow and allows currency and value to return to\ntheir origins\u2014\u2014i.e value is information, and the instantaneous flow without friction can be achieved through Bit (the smallest unit of\ninformation).\nThe combination of the unlicensed and trust-free features of digital currency and blockchain technology, which gives it the opportunity\nto reshape the current financial and monetary system.\nThe birth of Ethereum has greatly expanded the capabilities of Bitcoin as a currency and settlement network. For the first time, we\nhave witnessed the rise of an expanding and self-improving financial protocol network.The Ethereum network has become a hotbed\nthat nurtures a new financial and monetary system with strong vitality. We can carry out activities such as token sale, stable currency,\ndecentralized trading, currency market, lending market, insurance, forecasting, games, etc. within a global range without permission,\ntrust-free, and non-friction, thus starting the new historical chapter for open finance.\nIn an open financial system, users always have control over their assets and do not need to rely on counter-parties (such as custodians\nor national sovereignty) to make financial decisions. The open financial system will promote faster and better innovation and iteration\nof financial protocols in order to provide better products and services to billions of people around the world.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"aquila-protocol","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12087/large/bfb90fWG_400x400.jpg?1597016683","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12087/small/bfb90fWG_400x400.jpg?1597016683","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12087/thumb/bfb90fWG_400x400.jpg?1597016683"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x423f3da166470030a86fa76280b2d688fce1f722","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x423f3da166470030a86fa76280b2d688fce1f722"],"facebook_username":"peter.auxer.585","homepage":["http://aquila.finance/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"AquilaOfficial","twitter_screen_name":"AuxToken"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Aquila Protocol","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"aux","tickers":[]}
