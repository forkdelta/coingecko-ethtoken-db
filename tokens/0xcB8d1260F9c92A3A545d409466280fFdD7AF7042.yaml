description: >-
  The NFT Protocol Token (ticker: $NFT) will be a utility token enabled on the Blockparty platform. $NFT
  is designed as a decentralized protocol that intends to establish liquidity for non-fungible digital
  assets (“NFT’s”).  Staking contracts should enable NFT sellers to offer their assets for deferred exchange.
  During the deferral period, miners could establish NFT index contract prices based on the NFT’s synthetic
  demand and supply, enabling price discovery prior to transaction with the final buyers. Thus, the protocol
  is designed to enable trustless, transparent, and frictionless pricing and exchange. NFT is an upgrade
  of the already existing Blockparty BOXX token.
