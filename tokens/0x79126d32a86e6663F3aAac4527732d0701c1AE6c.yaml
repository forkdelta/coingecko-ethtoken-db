description: >-
  The Dark Matter ecosystem enables people to create interlinked projects while allowing each project
  to regain full autonomy and independence. The separate projects on the Dark Matter network don’t have
  to rely on each other, but if they make profit, the revenue is distributed to all Dark Matter Token
  liquidity providers. It’s a simple way to incentivize creativity and exploring new possibilities of
  blockchain technology.


  A large number of the projects created in the Dark Matter ecosystem explore the idea of Non-Fungible
  Tokens. NFTs are currently one of the few popular solutions which successfully combine blockchain technology
  with the creative freedom of art.
