  GameCoin (GMC) is a digital currency targeted towards the gaming community. GMC tokens go on sale at
  the end of September through the GameCoin ICO.


  GameCoin aims to increase the revenue of the gaming industry by 3 times – or 300 billion dollars per
  year. It aims to allow players to earn money from their hobby. And, within a year, the developers claim
  the capitalization of GameCoin will “exceed and billion dollars and will continue to grow rapidly.”

  GameCoin is being proposed as a way to monetize the world of free gaming. The GameCoin whitepaper explains
  that the majority of gaming revenue comes from 10% of users. Today, developers are struggling to monetize
  the remaining 90% of users. GameCoin claims to have found a way to do that using blockchain technology.


  Basically, GameCoin’s idea is to allow each game developer to create their own cryptocurrency. This
  cryptocurrency is used as in-game money. The developers can create this cryptocurrency at virtually
  no cost to themselves – it’s just a digital token that has value in the game. However, by the time it
  circulates through gamers, the token will have value because it can be used to pay for in-game items.


  In more straightforward terms, GameCoin plans to make it easy for developers to create a secure in-game
  currency. It appears that these cryptocurrencies will operate as forks on the GameCoin blockchain. Each
  developer will be able to make their own fork – so gamers can easily apply their GWC tokens to any game
  of their choice (the GameCoin wallet will support all forks).
