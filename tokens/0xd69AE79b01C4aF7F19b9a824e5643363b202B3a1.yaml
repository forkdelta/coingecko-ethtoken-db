  Duet is a synthetic assets protocol in the brand new paradigm, it has a hybrid mechanism of over-collateralization
  and algorithm-pegging model.


  Duet allows users to create any quoted assets from the real world on the chain, such as stocks, commodities,
  futures, and bonds. Instead of selling crypto assets into fiat currency, Duet enables users to allocate
  capital to any assets with only one crypto wallet.


  Compared to other synthetic asset protocols, Duet's goal is not simply a financial application, but
  a real parallel universe that enables real world asset casting, recomposition, and restructuring on
  the blockchain.


  A Duet in music refers to a piece of music where two people play different parts or melodies. Similarly,
  the Duet protocol allows traders to replicate the real-world tradable assets in a decentralized finance
  ecosystem.
