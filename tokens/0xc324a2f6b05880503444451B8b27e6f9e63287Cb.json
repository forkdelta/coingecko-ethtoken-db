The team is on a mission to solve one of crypto\u2019s most prominent issues \u2013 illiquidity. Most investors have experienced this first-hand: You find a digital asset you like and want to invest in. However, the coin is only available on a handful of exchanges. On top of that, you can only use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> to trade for it. This leads to a sometimes hour-long process filled with multiple manual transfers over at least two exchanges.\n\nPayment channels provide an instant way to transfer digital assets off-chain between two parties. The transactions are only recorded on the blockchain when the payment channel is first opened and when it\u2019s closed. You can think of it as updating balances on both ends of the channel for each transfer. Once you close the payment channel, both parties get their respective final balances. Payment channels are trustless \u2013 any disputes are resolved automatically through cryptography. And, transfers using them are secured by the underlying blockchain making them as reliable as exchanges on the blockchain itself. Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network and Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network\">Raiden Network</a> are two of the most popular examples of payment channels.\n\nJames Wo (CEO), Terry Culver (CSO), Mikael Wang (Chief Blockchain Architect), and Kilian Rausch (Product Director) lead the Exchange Union management team.
