  FrogDAO is a decentralized incubator that helps promising projects achieve their full potential by leveraging
  the investment power and buzz making potential of our community.


  Unlike other decentralized incubators, FrogDAO specializes in projects who are looking to build on Cardano
  (ADA).


  Because of the unsafe nature of Crypto, FrogDAO especially values the safety brought to both users and
  developers on the Cardano Network.
