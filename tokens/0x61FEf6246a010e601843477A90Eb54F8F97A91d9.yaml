description: >-
  we are students from Mexican university in  our first development for a cryptocurrency.  We are working
  a lot and we hope that our idol pancho will be proud of us wherever is him . Everyone will be proud
  of Mexico with our token also. We are giving a lot of coins in airdrops and a first IEO has concluded
  few days ago collecting around 4 btc. We are working in a few releases for the few months as can be
  our website, white-paper, and a small exchange platform for pancho to be traded vs other coins. We've
  planned 2 more IEO rounds or the burnt the coins leftover. We would love to ask you please to add us
  to your prestigious site as soon as posible, we have to be listed in yobit, as the fee has been paid,
  also, we have a good vol in etherflyer and request to coinmarketcap is being sent today also.  thank
  you in advance
