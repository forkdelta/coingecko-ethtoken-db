  The core idea of FACTS is to construct a set of “Factual Content Incentive Mechanism “that is based
  on blockchain technology, namely Proof of Facts (PoF). Users can obtain the right of reward allocation
  through any operational behavior on the factual content. By doing so, they help to solve current problems
  on the Internet such as massive false content, underpowered creation, low propagation efficiency and
  so on.FACTS uates content through the “FACTS Index” assessment model which provides a strong credibility
  reference for content review panel and users. After the assessment, the trusted content is stored in
  the Facts Pool and then is automatically used to build Facts Graph through the NLP engine.
