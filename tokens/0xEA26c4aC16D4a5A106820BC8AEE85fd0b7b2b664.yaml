  QuarkChain is a secure, permission-less, scalable, and decentralized blockchain. One of the goals of
  QuarkChain is to utilize sharding technology to deliver over 1 million transactions per second (tps).
  Essentially, QuarkChain markets itself as a peer-to-peer blockchain with a high capacity throughput
  to help deliver fast and secure decentralized applications. The team behind QuarkChain created this
  blockchain to resolve the issue of scalability that all the major blockchains are currently facing.
  The team feels that because of the urgency of this issue, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
  community simply cannot afford to wait until they all agree on a solution. Instead, they feel that by
  offering different solutions, such as the one inherent in QuarkChain, this compels the community to
  split via a hard fork and find the solution that works best.


  QuarkChain encourages increased decentralization through multiple cheap nodes that then create a cluster
  that works as a super-full node. This prevents the high expenses associated with super-full nodes when
  the tps gets high. In terms of protection, all transactions within QuarkChain get the protection of
  50 percent of the network’s hash power. This makes a double-spending attack incredibly challenging,
  particularly when combined with QuarkChain’s decentralized nature.


  QuarkChain relies on a two-layer blockchain structure. Sharding blockchains known as shards are the
  first layer, while the second layer is a root blockchain that confirms the shards’ blocks.The major
  work on QuarkChain began in Q2 2017 with research into the problem of blockchain scalability. In Q4
  of that year, the team drafted the whitepaper. In February 2018, it released the white paper and completed
  verification code 0.1. March 2018 saw the 0.1 versions of both the wallet and testnet. Now in Q2, the
  team is working on the testnet 1.0 and smart contract 0.1. In Q4 2018, the team will have the QuarkChain
  Core 1.0, along with the mainnet 1.0 and the SmartWallet 1.0. By Q2 2019, both the SmartWallet and QuarkChain
  Core will be in their 2.0 versions.


  QuarkChain is a decentralized blockchain network that aims to resolve the issues of scalability that
  plague existing networks by using sharding technology. In this way, QuarkChain can dramatically extend
  the usefulness of blockchain technology since many applications are limited by the scalability of existing
  blockchain networks. The project is still in progress, but QuarkChain has already made many positive
  steps and already began invite-based beta testing for the testnet, showing significant progress and
  potential.


  The main features of Quarkchain are:


  1. Reshardable two-layered blockchain: Quarkchain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic
  sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain as the second layer that confirms
  the blocks from the first layer. The second layer that confirms the blocks from the first layer. The
  second layer is flexible to be resharded as needed without changing the root layer.


  2. Guaranteed security by market-driven collaborative mining: To ensure the security of all transactions,
  a game-theoretic framework is designed for incentives, where at least 50% of overall hash powers are
  allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack on any transactions.


  3. Anti-centralized horizontal scalability: In any blockchain network with a high TPS, a super-full
  node can be extremely expensive, which encourages centralization. In contrast, QuarkChain allows multiple
  cheap nodes forming a cluster to replace a super-full node.


  4. Efficient cross-shard transactions: Cross-shard transactions in QuarkChain can be issued at any time,
  and confirmed in minutes. The speed of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of
  shards increases.


  5. Simple account management: There is only one account needed for the entire blockchain (shards) in
  QuarkChain. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet.
