  Vid aims to become a next-generation video journaling application that gives control to its users. Data
  is secured through zero-knowledge encryption, so only the user can access their content. Blockchain
  technology powers the companyâ€™s internal VID Token, which is a digital currency used to transfer value
  across the network. Content creators can earn VID Tokens when other users view their videos. Brands
  and advertisers can also pay content creators directly with the VID Token, without Vid taking a cut.


  The company has developed proprietary technology that leverages AI and machine learning techniques to
  automatically edit clips to the beat of the music, identify the most relevant parts of a clip, speed
  up and slow down content, and apply filters that give the final product a polished and professional
  feel. Vid holds two patents that protect its technology, with several others in review. The company
  is headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite offices in South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the
  Cayman Islands.
