  In January 2018, we expanded our business to “Adappter” service, which provides various blockchain information
  and live content from “Houjaeki” service, which provides data on favorable factors in real time. Currently,
  about 50,000 users who have interests in blockchain (including Android and iOS) use the Adappter service.


  ADP is Token published by Adappter, operated within the Ethereum platform (ERC20), and used as a key
  currency in the adapter ecosystem. It can convert AP, which was received as compensation for partner
  contents, to ADP and it will continue for 20 years. In the future, it will provide real-life payment
