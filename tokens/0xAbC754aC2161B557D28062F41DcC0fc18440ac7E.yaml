description: >-
  "My strategy for this Set is very simple - all of the ETH in the Set will be held until ETH reaches
  a price of $10,000 USD. Once this happens, the Set will sell all of its ETH for DAI.



  By buying into this Set, you're also helping to support EthHub as all of the entry fees generated by
  this Set are automatically sent to the EthHub donation address at ethhub.eth"
