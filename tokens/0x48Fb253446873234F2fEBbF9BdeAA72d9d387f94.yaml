description: >-
  vBNT is the governance token of Bancor. It is generated by users who stake BNT in any whitelisted pool
  and represents their % ownership of the pool. This makes vBNT similar to an LP token, except you can
  also use it to vote in Bancor governance. With the release of Vortex, youâ€™ll also be able to use vBNT
  to borrow against your staked liquidity by swapping your vBNT for any token in the network.
