  BITCOIN WHEELCHAIR project's primary objective is to build indoor sports facilities to be specially
  designed for the physically, hearing and visually impaired in metropolitan cities including Istanbul.
  For the facility to be built in Istanbul, an interview was made with Başakşehir Municipality and a promise
  of 10 acres of land was taken. The project will also be constructed in Başakşehir, and there will also
  be a 100-room guest house built next to the indoor sports hall. All rooms and social areas in the guesthouse
  will be specially designed for the physically, hearing and visually impaired individuals.When the facility
  project is implemented, a certain discount is planned if the guests will stay with the BTCWH in order
  to encourage them to pay with.
