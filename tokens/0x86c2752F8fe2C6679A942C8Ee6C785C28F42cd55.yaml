  BitMinutes is a global financial services technology platform powered by its proprietary BMT token,
  an Ethereum blockchain-based ERC-20 token. The platform provides a number of functionalities and capabilities
  that bring efficiencies and enhancements to fill critical gaps in existing market technology and processes.
  First, through its proprietary patent-pending Atomic Swap software, any wallet built with BitMinutes
  technology can offer fiat and crypto-currency trading within the wallet. No need to extract assets to
  trade on an exchange to rebalance, add to or subtract from your portfolio. Second, through the wholly
  owned Trusted Agent Network (TAN), BitMinutes solves the “last mile” problem of cash in/cash out that
  bedevils most FinTech solutions – a key cornerstone according to the Gates Foundation and Mastercard
  for driving financial inclusion globally. Everyday citizens of developing countries can add cash through
  their local Trusted Agents (often a local retail merchant), transact, buy various currencies, and send
  value for free to other wallets anywhere in the world, where the recipients can then convert their assets
  back into cash through their local agent. Third, the BitMinute is tied to a real-world asset, prepaid
  phone minutes. It is a universal prepaid minute that can be converted to airtime on any mobile phone.
  Fourth, through its affiliate company UberFi, tranches of BitMinutes provide the foundation for a DeFi
  liquidity pool that can kickstart micro-lending programs within any country we operate. The BitMinutes
  ecosystem is live in both Nigeria, where a network of Trusted Agents is growing under the BitMinutes
  brand, and in Kenya, where it provides the technological backbone for the Akoin project that has launched
  in Mwale City. BitMinutes wallet and exchange technology is also going live in Guatemala, where we are
  creating a joint venture partnership with Genesis to build a micro-loan program based on BMTs. The BitMinutes
  program is focused on expanding financial inclusion throughout the developing world using this next
  generation technology. Our mission is to eliminate the expensive middlemen who take a cut in every payments
  transaction or charge exorbitant rates on loans to consumers and small businesspeople.
