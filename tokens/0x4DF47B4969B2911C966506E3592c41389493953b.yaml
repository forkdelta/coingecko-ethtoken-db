  FundRequest is more than a platform to fund projects. We provide the best experience to fund an issue
  and incentivise the open source community. FundRequest breaks down barriers traditionally encountered
  in open source by providing a support layer between no support and enterprise level support. The ease
  of use of the FundRequest platform enables users to fund issues without any coding knowledge. It allows
  developers to search for funded issues that best match their skill set to solve.
