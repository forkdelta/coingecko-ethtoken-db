description: >-
  To promote the circulation of value and its conversion, TREELION issues a digital currency called TRN.
  TRN acts as a token of the trading platform for green digital assets. TRN is also a means of exchange
  in the TREELION green digital economy ecosystem. TREELION works with third-party developers and applications
  to promote the usage of TRN as a payment token.


  TREELION is the infrastructure that allows the production, management and distribution of green digital
  assets. We will build a blockchain trading platform for green assets and provide green digital financial
  solutions by implementing exchange standards, and support enterprise-level green asset registration,
  management, transactions, certifications, and other services to solve the current pain points of the
  green economy.
