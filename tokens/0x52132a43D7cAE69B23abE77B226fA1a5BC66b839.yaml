  TruAmple (TMPL) is an erc20 token, based on innovative flexible supply and demand model. This implies
  that the absolute price of TMPL is continually evolving depending upon the demand.

  We have Eliminated the Fixed target price and introduced floating/balancing price target depending upon
  the Oracle price of TMPL, so whenever the price go higher the floating target price shifts itself and
  tries to manage the risk of fall back thus maintaining the equilibrium.

  Foremost the base price of TMPL is not pegged to $1, hence with every increase in Oracle price of TMPL
  , the target price will also shift to the new target price. We move the target price as the price goes
  up. While fixed target price makes it unstable and carries the risks of sudden knee jerk loss in price,
  the floating target price protects the token from such situation.
