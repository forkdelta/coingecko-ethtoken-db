description: >-
  LenDeFi allows secured lending and removes any counterparty risk between the borrower and the lender,
  who then can deal on a trustless basis.


  The lender will receive a variable interest and be secured by the liquidity provided on the DeFi ecosystem
  in such protocols as Uniswap . Hence, if the borrower is not able to maintain their loan, the Protocol
  will ensure the lender is repaid and the borrower credited with the remaining equity.

  Borrowers can select from a wide variety of supported assets to invest by borrowing funds from the Protocol.
  Supported assets can be added and removed via Lendefi’s decentralized governance mechanism (the “DAO”).
