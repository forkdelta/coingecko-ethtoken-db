  PL^Gnet enables creation of synthetic assets from multiple chains, which can leverage DeFi in one network,
  using a simple UX from your existing trusted provider.


  PL^Gnet aims to solve the problems identified by:

  • Introducing a new solution to enable deeper liquidity pools for assets from different chains

  • Leveraging existing compliance onboarding processes to create shareable attestations, in order to
  enhance compliance in DeFi for developers and traditional finance providers

  • Reduce complexity for assets to exist in the same smart contract network while enhancing existing
  multi-chain approaches.

  • Provide a safer environment for new users to access DeFi products (such as borrowing and lending platforms
  and derivatives exchanges) without taking on the risks of self-custody

  • Enable exchanges, staking providers and custodians to offer DeFi connectivity and leverage assets
  “at rest” in a novel way
