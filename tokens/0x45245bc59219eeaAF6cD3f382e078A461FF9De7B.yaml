description: >-
  "BANKEX is a fintech company that utilizes blockchain technology to create the infrastructure for the
  decentralization of the worldâ€™s capital markets.

  BANKEX offers a model wherein possession of its tokens gives users perpetual free access to its services.
  This is a lot like a subscription to web services, except that payment is only made once, instead of
  on a regular basis.

  Ownership of BKX tokens provides free secure cryptocurrency storage with BANKEX Custody Service, pays
  for escrow commissions and buys arbitration votes in Digital Deal, and will have an important role to
  play in the BANKEX Security Token ecosystem."
