description: >-
  The BTC Min Volatility Set is for you if you believe the price of Bitcoin will swing minimally in the
  medium term. This Set automatically rebalances cash (DAI) into BTC if the price of BTC dips more than
  10% and BTC into cash (DAI) if the price of BTC rebounds more than 20%. The token tolerances are selected
  to enhance any crypto portfolio by buying dips and taking profits more frequently.
