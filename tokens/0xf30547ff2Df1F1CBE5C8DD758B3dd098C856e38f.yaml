description: >-
  RAI Finance is a protocol designed to provide DeFi with a wider range of assets, a higher amount of
  liquidity, and a diverse set of financial use cases. When this feature set is combined with the cross-chain
  compatibility of the Polkadot ecosystem, it eliminates fragmentation across the existing DeFi ecosystem
  by bringing a complement of new assets and a higher amount of liquidity to decentralized finance.
