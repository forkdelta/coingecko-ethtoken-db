This Set automatically rebalances cash (DAI) into BTC if the price of BTC dips more than 20% and BTC into cash (DAI) if the price of BTC rebounds more than 25%. The token tolerances are selected to balance profit against risk, preventing token holders from selling into a rally (or buying into a drop) yet still taking profits when the downside of missing a trade is too high.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"btc-range-bond-low-volatility-set","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10604/large/btc_buy_the_dip_%281%29_%282%29.png?1580970613","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10604/small/btc_buy_the_dip_%281%29_%282%29.png?1580970613","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10604/thumb/btc_buy_the_dip_%281%29_%282%29.png?1580970613"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/set-protocol","https://www.linkedin.com/company/set-protocol/about/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x20649d97b1393105cf92a5083fd2afF7C99eBe56"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/x3PGVfP"],"homepage":["https://www.tokensets.com/set/btclovol"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/SetProtocol/set-protocol-contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"SetProtocol"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"BTC Range Bond Low Volatility Set","public_interest_score":0.013,"symbol":"btclovol","tickers":[{"base":"0X20649D97B1393105CF92A5083FD2AFF7C99EBE56","market":{"identifier":"token_sets","name":"TokenSets"},"target":"USD"}]}
