  Xpense is a decentralized global shopping and consumption scene alliance ecosystem. Xpense combines
  image recognition technology based on blockchain to store user consumption data and behavior data. Xpense
  is built by face recognition technology and big data AI algorithm. Globally unified consumer value assessment
  system and user smart consumer passports. Xpense – extracting value from individual consumption and
  consumer behavior. Xpense will start a revolution on offline consumer experience and attract more users
  returning to brick and mortar stores.


  Mining through facial recognition

  The age of living off your face has come! Consumers can be rewarded tokens by scanning their faces at
  the offline stores which join Xpense platform program. Tokens can be converted into cash on third-party
  market or exchanged for all sorts of goods and services from the stores.


  Making shopping full of fun

  Xpense itself or stores on the platform can launch various shopping tasks based on facial recognition.
  After the completion of these tasks, consumers will be rewarded with token. These game-like tasks will
  reshape the offline consumption experience and make shopping much more interesting.


  KYC Capability

  Under traditional business model, offline stores are not able to obtain the background information of
  each new customer, so targeted selling can not be achieved. While stores joined Xpense are empowered
  with the KYC (Know Your Customer) capability, therefore they can easily acquire the consumption portrait
  and other information of every client who has visited their stores. This is essential for them to improve
  the Price per Customer and success rate of sales.


  Helping stores win more customers

  Joining Xpense enables stores to access consumption portraits of the people nearby and push precise
  marketing information to them. This will tremendously improve stores’ ability to gain more customers
  because the people nearby are the most likely potential customers.


  Design of Xpense consumption & behavior data platform

  Through the use of blockchain technology, Xpense will record all consumption and behavioral data involved
  by initially recording data on the side chain or off the chain and finally writing data into the backbone
  of Xpense data management chain. This is to ensure its growth comes from the records of consumption
  and behavioral data and avoid alteration or falsification. In the future, with the blockchain distributed
  storage technology getting more mature, the backbone of Xpense data management chain will also be transferred
  or stored on blockchain distributed storage. For truly achieving decentralization, we have adopted the
  following technologies.


  1.Blockchain based distributed ledger technology

  2.Side- chain and cross-chain trading technology

  3.DPOS consensus algorithm

  4.Smart AI video recognition technology
