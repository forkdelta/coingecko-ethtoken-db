  SEFI is the governance token for SecretSwap and the Secret Network DeFi ecosystem. Users of SecretSwap
  can earn SEFI to participate in shaping the future of Secret Network's front-running resistant, privacy-first
  open financial system.


  SecretSwap is a protocol for creating liquidity and trading SNIP-20 tokens on Secret Network. Leveraging
  privacy-preserving ""secret"" smart contracts, SecretSwap protects users against malicious front-running
  and privacy threats, provides access to cross-chain liquidity, and reduces fees relative to Ethereum.


  SEFI is an application layer governance token specifically for Secret Swap parameters, developer fund
  spending, and application related changes. This is in contrast to SCRT, which is the native governance
  token of the Secret Network protocol layer.
