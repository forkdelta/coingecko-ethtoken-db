  Bancor is a blockchain protocol that allows users to convert between different tokens directly as opposed
  to exchanging them on cryptocurrency markets. The project offers a network, which we’ll discuss soon,
  that works to bring liquidity to the majority of tokens that lack a consistent supply/demand in exchanges.
  That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart
  Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency
  market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
  or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> because there are always buyers
  and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of
  other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention
  in the market to be liquid.


  Bancor’s protocol uses smart contracts to create Smart Tokens, which serve as an alternative mechanism
  for trading. A key characteristic of the protocol is that it doesn’t call for an exchange of tokens
  with a second party, as in the case of cryptocurrency exchanges. Rather, it employs Smart Tokens to
  convert between different ERC-20 tokens internally. These conversions take place through the blockchain’s
  protocol and completely outside of cryptocurrency exchanges. Smart Tokens process token conversions
  internally by holding reserves of other ERC20 tokens within their Smart Contract. They can then convert
  back and forth between those reserves as users request it.


  The Bancor team consists of a core Foundation Council and their Advisory Board. The Foundation Council
  includes four individuals based out of Zug, Switzerland. Bernard Lietaer is a Belgian civil engineer,
  economist, author, and professor. Lietaer specialized in monetary systems and promotes the notion of
  communities creating their own local currencies. Guy Benartzi serves as co-founder and is recognized
  for founding the gaming company, Mytopia. Benartzi also co-founded Particle Code, a development studio
  based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Guido Schmitz-Krummacher is an executive of the Bancor Protocol foundation
  that’s involved with a variety of commercial entrepreneurial ventures in Switzerland. His involvement
  in the crypto space includes that of Bancor as well as an executive position in crowdfunding network,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tezos">Tezos (XTZ)</a>.


  One of the key elements of the Bancor Network is the automated pricing. This comes from the Smart Tokens’
  built-in automated market makers. These automated market makers mean that the tokens’ smart contracts
  always buy or sell Smart Tokens from or to any user in exchange for any connector token (as well as
  any token found in the network). The price comes from the Bancor Formula. This formula that is responsible
  for balancing a Smart Token’s demand and supply while also maintaining the ratio between the token’s
  total value with the connector token balances. The creator of the Smart Token configures these ratios,
  known as the connector weight. The creator can adjust them with the goal of decreasing or increasing
  the liquidity level of the token. The connector weight indicates price sensitivity, or how much sells
  and buys affect the price movement. Any time the prices no longer syncs with prices listed on external
  exchanges, the arbitrageurs will quickly balance the gaps."
