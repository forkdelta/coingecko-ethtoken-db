  CTSI Overview and Use Cases


  CTSI is a utility token that works as a crypto-fuel for Noether.

  Stakers receive CTSI rewards by staking their tokens and participating in the network.

  Node runners are selected randomly according to a PoS system and gain the right to create the next block.

  Users of the network pay CTSI fees to insert data on the side-chain.

  CTSI will also be used for DApps to outsource the execution of verifiable and enforceable computation
  to entities running Descartes nodes.
