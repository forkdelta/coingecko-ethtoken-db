  Current social networks flood users’ feeds with hidden agendas, which is the result of auctioning off
  their data to the highest bidder. Uhive tackles this problem head on by leveraging its own cryptocurrency
  - Uhive Token HVE2 - to create revenue streams that include peer-to-peer transactions, sale of NFTs,
  and interest-based advertising, as well as the sale of in-app digital assets, so that a user’s privacy
  is never compromised in the name of profit.

  By tying economics to the quality of content on the platform, users on Uhive are constantly incentivized
  to create great content. Users can use tokens to power transactions on the network, or simply exchange
  them on a cryptocurrency exchange for traditional currency or other digital currencies.

  It’s our mission is to create the most sustainable, creative, fun, and transparent social media platform
  in the world!
