description: >-
  EcoFi is an open-source, permissionless, and censorship-resistant protocol built to power safe and responsible
  innovation in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space.


  The EcoFi protocol is designed to equitably disburse value among system participants through a unique
  infrastructure hinging on infinite scarcity, made possible due to the unique mechanics of EcoFi's distribution
  mechanism. This is achieved by staking ECO tokens through the EcoFi protocol to mint SPRT tokens.


  SPRT tokens can be used to purchase digital goods from an ecosystem connected to the EcoFI Platform
  comprising numerous marketplaces. The first such marketplace will be the HyperObject FINE ART NFT Gallery,
  a one-of-a-kind digital art gallery featuring FINE ART NFTs backed by distinct physical editions.


  Once the marketplace is sufficiently stable, EcoFi will transition to a DAO governance model.
