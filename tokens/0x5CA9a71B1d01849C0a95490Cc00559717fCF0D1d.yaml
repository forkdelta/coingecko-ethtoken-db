  æternity is a public, open-source blockchain protocol that enables a platform for next-generation decentralized
  applications with high scalability. Its core components are written in the functional programming language
  Erlang and its smart contract language - Sophia - is also functional. æternity has a stellar team of
  developers including Robert Virding - co-creator of Erlang, John Hughes - co-designer of Haskell, and
  Ulf Norell - co-designer of the Agda programming language for formal verification.


  Unlike other blockchain platforms, the æternity protocol itself incorporates a number of essential technological
  features. State channels for off-chain scaling, oracles for real-world information, and a naming system
  for increased user-friendliness are all implemented on Layer 1. æternity also features SDKs in Javascript,
  GO, Phyton, Java, as well as a middleware and a development suite that streamline smart contract development.


  æternity incorporates the Bitcoin-NG consensus algorithm developed by academics from Cornell University
  and uses the Cuckoo Cycle mining algorithm for Sybil attack protection.


  AE tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the æternity platform, is used for both - an economic unit of
  account and as ballots in the community-driven on-chain governance votes.
