  Ampleforth is a digital-asset-protocol for smart commodity-money.


  The smart commodity money with a unique elastic supply protocol. AMPL supply expands and contracts in
  response to it’s price deviating from a 1 USD target. Deviations result in a supply change of AMPLs
  once every 24 hours, increasing or decreasing the number of tokens in each holder’s wallet pro-rata.
  Ampleforth is the only asset in the world with this elastic supply property, and therefore has counter-cyclical
  trading pressure and is uncorrelated with other digital assets such as Bitcoin.
