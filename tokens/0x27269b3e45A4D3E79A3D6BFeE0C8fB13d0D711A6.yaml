description: >-
  Inversely tracks the price of Ripple (XRP) through price feeds supplied by an oracle. The entry point
  is $0.2605 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when it reaches its
  upper limit of $0.3908 (i.e. when Ripple's value reaches $0.1302) or its lower limit of $0.1303 (i.e.
  when Rippleâ€™s value reaches $0.3907). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no
  longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its
  frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted for another
  iXRP with different limits.
