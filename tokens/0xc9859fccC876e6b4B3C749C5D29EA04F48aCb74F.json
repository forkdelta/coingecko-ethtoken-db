Our aim is to draw in a large pool of funding applicants and pick the ones who prove they deserve the investment. We base our decisions on a set of criteria that are purely objective, built as a result of our extensive experience with investing. This guarantees that InoCoin will keep growing, because it is not directly tied to the market, but only to the select, high-quality startups we choose to fund.\n\nThey use blockchain technology because we believe in its future, because we are business people and have a logical outlook. Providing transactions many times quicker and cheaper than are currently the norm makes blockchain the perfect decentralized system. It gives every person the opportunity to be a successful investor, whereas a classical banking system limits investment options to just a small circle of well-funded individuals. InoCoin works both for startups and for investors. We strive for win-win deals. Every successful startup is a win both for investors and for InoCoin.\n\nINO coin is a utility token that will pave the way to the future of crowdfunding.
