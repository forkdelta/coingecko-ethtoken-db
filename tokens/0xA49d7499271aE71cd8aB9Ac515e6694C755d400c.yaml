description: >-
  MUTE is one half of the dual-token mechanics powering the Mute.io ZK-Rollup ecosystem.


  MUTE is the gas that facilitates growth of the ecosystem via the DAO, funding proposals and benefitting
  directly through a 'buyback and make' initiative. Liquidity providers are also rewarded thanks to a
  1% transaction fee, guarding against impermeant loss and paid out incrementally via the MuteVault contract.


  Mute Switch, an easy to use swap-style ZK-Rollup DEX, is the first Dapp in the ecosystem. This will
  be running on ZK-Rollup infrastructure meaning trading will be cheaper and more scalable, but not just
  that - transactions will be zero knowledge, ensuring nobody can see into your wallet history. Power
  users of the DEX will qualify for reduced fees by locking a specified amount of MUTE in their wallet.


  The non-inflationary supply is complimented by an innovative economic model that includes the combination
  of buy backs, coin burns, a smart treasury and vaults.
