description: >-
  The Refraction is a collectively owned yet individually influenced NFT experiment.


  One NFT Artwork, assembled from 1 Master & 100 Layers.

  Sharded into 100 Tokens, connected to one Layer each.

  The Tokens are traded on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) where the price of one token is determined by
  supply & demand on a bonding curve.

  Whenever a token is getting bought (or sold) on the DEX, one random layer is turned on (or off).


  The project is a collaboration between crypto artist, Sven Eberwein and DAOfi.
