Each Stably Dollar token is legally backed and redeemable for a US Dollar held in FDIC-insured escrow accounts managed by our fiduciary custodians, such as Prime Trust.\n\nThe biggest and most obvious problem with using popular cryptocurrencies for transactional purposes at the moment is price volatility. By making Stably Dollar redeemable and pegged 1-to-1 with US dollars, we can virtually eliminate volatility while still retaining many useful characteristics of a cryptocurrency - including fast transaction speed, anonymity, and immutability.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"stableusd","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/large/stably.png?1573625549","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/small/stably.png?1573625549","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7596/thumb/stably.png?1573625549"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe","https://etherscan.io/token/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa4bdb11dc0a2bec88d24a3aa1e6bb17201112ebe"],"chat_url":["https://www.instagram.com/stableusd/"],"facebook_username":"stablycoin","homepage":["https://www.stably.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"StablyCoin"},"liquidity_score":46.765,"market_cap_rank":755,"name":"Stably Dollar","public_interest_score":26.086,"symbol":"USDS","tickers":[{"base":"BTCB-1DE","market":{"identifier":"binance_dex","name":"Binance DEX"},"target":"USDSB-1AC"},{"base":"USDS","market":{"identifier":"crex24","name":"CREX24"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"USDS","market":{"identifier":"kyber_network","name":"Kyber Network"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"USDS","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"USDS","market":{"identifier":"vcc","name":"VCC Exchange"},"target":"BTC"}]}
