  Game Stars - blockchain platform that helps to monetize cyberathletes' professional advancement It is
  a multifunctional blockchain-based gaming platform, where players can raise funds for their professional
  development and sponsors are able to support the most promising cyber sportsmen. The idea of the platform
  was formed by professional cyberathletes who have a personal experience with the obstacles existing
  in e-sports and know the solutions which are likely to improve the situation. So we are solving the
  key problems of the rapidly developing e-sports market. In addition, we already have more than 500 interested
  users and a valuable token.

  Basic features of the platform:

  - Players can attract funds for their professional advancement, create their own tournaments and participate
  in those held by others

  - Team managers can enhance the advancement of their own players, find new team members, attract advertisers
  and sponsors

  - Investors can offer support to the most promising cyberathletes and receive return on their investment.

  - Advertisers can choose a suitable team, player, or event to promote their brands.

  Issues in Cybersports and our Solutions:

  1. There is no guarantee of adherence to the terms and conditions of tournaments or payment of prize
  money - Our solution: Holding tournaments using smart contracts

  2. Players struggle to advance professionally without sponsors' support and have no effective tools
  to protect themselves from fraud and dishonest schemes - Our solution: The range of functions offered
  by "Cyberathlete ICO" allows the cyberathlete to get funding for his/her professional development. Allocation
  of the cyberathlete's revenues is recorded in the smart contract.

  3. There is no structured system of relations among market players - Our solution: GameStars is an all-in-one
  platform with an infrastructure facilitating interactions among cyberathletes, managers, and sponsors.

  4. Organizing your own tournament is an expensive and challenging task - Our solution: There are tournament
  organization scenarios already developed on the platform. All you need to do is fill out the form.
