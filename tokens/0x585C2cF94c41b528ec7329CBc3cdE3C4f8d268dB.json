This Set automatically rebalances cash (DAI) into ETH if the price of ETH dips more than 30% and ETH into cash (DAI) if the price of ETH rebounds more than 35%. The token tolerances are selected to balance profit against risk, preventing token holders from selling into a rally (or buying into a drop) yet still taking profits when the downside of missing a trade is too high.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"eth-range-bound-low-volatility-set","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10603/large/eth_buy_the_dip.png?1580969865","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10603/small/eth_buy_the_dip.png?1580969865","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10603/thumb/eth_buy_the_dip.png?1580969865"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/set-protocol","https://www.linkedin.com/company/set-protocol/about/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/address/0x585C2cF94c41b528ec7329CBc3cdE3C4f8d268dB"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/x3PGVfP"],"homepage":["https://www.tokensets.com/set/ethlovol"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/SetProtocol/set-protocol-contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"SetProtocol"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"ETH Range Bound Low Volatility Set","public_interest_score":0.016,"symbol":"ethlovol","tickers":[]}
