description: >-
  Meet Hina Inu ($HINA), the sister token to Keisuke Inu ($KEI).  Hina Inu ($HINA) is a decentralized,
  peer-to-peer deflationary meme token that passively rewards its holders with a 2% tax redistribution
  for all transactions. We are currently on route to becoming a STAKING platform for both $HINA & our
  brother token $KEI!  Hina Inu is on a mission to join the $KEI family and create a bigger ecosystem
  all together.


  The developing team will be introducing a launchpad that will host staking of both coins in return for
  extra rewards.
