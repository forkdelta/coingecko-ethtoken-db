  Blockchains are quickly becoming the modern equivalent of what apps were to smartphones when they took
  off a decade ago. There’s a blockchain for everything - from cloud storage <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/siacoin">(Siacoin)</a>
  to identity verification <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/civic">(Civic)</a>. But the original
  point of Bitcoin, the very cryptocurrency was to overturn the traditional banking system. An interestingly
  named token - Bread, is here to bring us back on track for this original goal. Bread technology intends
  to reinvent and revolutionize banking as we know it. By building a blockchain synced, Bitcoin-based
  wallet, the idea here is to decentralise banking and make it accessible to everyone.


  With a blockchain connected, easy to use Bitcoin wallet, Bread makes it easy for you to transition to
  a truly decentralised banking service.It also provides portfolio management tools to offer a comprehensive
  banking experience. Purchases made using its BRD token attract loyalty points and rewards, giving customers
  another lucrative reason to use the Bread wallet app.


  Bread was officially launched in 2014 itself and even raised VC funding to the tune of $7 million in
  August 2017. It then went the ICO route in December 2017, where it made available 88 million BRD tokens.
  $32 million was raised in the price, with BRD being valued at the rate of 900 for every 1 ETH at the
  time. As of June 2018, just over 6 months later, its value had fallen to above 1600 for every 1 ETH.


  A decentralised banking system was <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin’s</a>
  original vision that is either taking too long to fruition, or we’ve become an impatient audience. Whatever
  the case, Bread wants to accelerate the transition. A significant decision the Bread team took was to
  introduce the BRD token - which, with its cheap rates and loyalty/discount offerings, may emerge as
  the primary incentive for users joining the platform. If this is indeed the case, expect a spike in
  the value of the BRD cryptocurrency, something investors right now would be eyeing closely. Having said
  that, its fall in value since the ICO is certainly a cause for concern, and investors are advised to
  do their research and analyse before taking decisions.
