description: >-
  SAKΞ is the first of its kind: a tokenized sake bridging tradition and technology with quality design.


  The pinnacle of the brewers' craft and technological innovation, every bottle of SAKΞ is a work of art.
  With the highest attention to the details of production, from planting rice seeds to hand-bottling to
  order, SAKΞ is curated by Sake Samurai Elliot Faber and produced by Kitanishi Shuzo, makers of Bunraku,
  with a bottle designed by BIG Architects and featuring the art of Jonathan Jay Lee.


  Only 888 bottles of SAKΞ will ever be made.
