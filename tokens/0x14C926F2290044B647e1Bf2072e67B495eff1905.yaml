  Bethereum uses concepts including gamification, user-friendly UX and simple account creation to create
  a unique betting platform for everyone. Bethereum is much more than just sports betting. In addition
  to limitless scalability, the platform can also handle additional items such as eSports, fantasy sports
  and casino-type games.


  We are already alpha testing the use of Smart Contracts for betting on the Ethereum test chain. Our
  goal is to eventually deliver instant payouts, unlimited winnings and transparency in fund management
  through our use of Ethereum technology. We’ve already registered more than 15,000 sports bets placed
  in our Alpha build.


  Our project has been met with widespread acclaim. We were among the finalists of the 2018 ICO Race,
  an event where over 150 projects applied. Bethereum also placed top 3 at Malta’s d10e Conference pitch
  contest.
