description: >-
  Our token is linked 1 to 1 to the current gold price, so our Token is a cryptocurrency gold stablecoin.

  So the gold price and thus the token price increases.

  For each token sold, we deposit the equivalent in physical gold.

  You can exchange your tokens (PGold) for real physical gold and have it sent to you at any time.

  This physical gold is safely deposited in one of our safes.

  So you donâ€™t have to worry about the gold being stored safely.

  Our Token is a storage for gold.

  If the gold price rises, the price of the token also rises.

  Currently, 1000 PGOLD tokens are equal to 1 gram of gold.

  The tokens that are not in circulation are securely held in an offline wallet and are only released
  if we also keep the equivalent in gold in a safe place.
