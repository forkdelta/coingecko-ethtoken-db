  HitChain is a decentralized and collaborative community built to value developersâ€™ works with a transparent
  credit system using blockchain technology. It is a community of the developers, by the developers, for
  the developers. HitChain provides a platform for developers to automatically redeem the value of innovation
  and creativity with compensation

  (currency value) and privileges (currency right). The self -governed system will guarantee that each
  member has the responsibility and right to participate in community decisions.


  HitChain community and the platform it runs on will embrace autonomy, democracy, transparency and fairness
  without any third-party intermediaries or centralized supervision. HitChain members will be among the
  first developers to recognize the full value of their efforts.
