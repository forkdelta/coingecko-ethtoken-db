  "Carry Protocol is a blockchain project that compensates consumers for sharing their data and receiving
  ads. Carry compensates individual consumers for 1. sharing their offline purchase data to build the
  most comprehensive offline purchase database, and 2. receiving ads from advertisers that use the Carry
  database to send targeted ads. Carry empowers consumers by giving them back the full control of their
  data and its monetization, and enables businesses to send targeted ads to the right consumers using
  the shared data.
