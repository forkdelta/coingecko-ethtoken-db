  BLOODY is a deflationary elastic experiment that clots if it doesn’t circulate.

  How does clotting work?

  Whenever the BLOODY transfer volume increases, everyone’s BLOODY balance gets a little bit bigger, whenever
  the BLOODY transfer volume decreases, everyone’s BLOODY balance gets a little bit smaller.

  How is it deflationary?

  Whenever there’s a BLOODY transfer, it spills. The faster it circulates, the higher the spill rate.

  How often are rebases?

  Hourly. After a rebase, transfers are frozen for 5 minutes.

  How are BLOODY liquidity providers incentivized?

  Half the spills are redistributed to BLOODY liquidity providers (up to 6% of ANY transfer).

  A BLOODY-ROT pool will be added to Rottenswap on Halloween.

  How is BLOODY initially distributed?

  BLOODY cannot be minted, it is distributed once on Oct 27th 2020 to ROT holders with a balance above
  7,500. The snapshot block (11106871) was chosen at random https://twitter.com/TheTimTempleton/status/1320722096578727937

  20% of airdrop supply is allocated to a marketing/dev fund for the ROT ecosystem (was requested and
  voted on in multiple governance proposals, not my personal preference).

  Are contracts audited?

  BLOODY is written 100% from scratch, not tested nor audited. It is NOT secure, use at your own risk.

  What does it BLOODY do?

  Nothing, it is an experiment with no purpose.
