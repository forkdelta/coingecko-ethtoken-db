description: >-
  This set uses my exclusive MoFlux algorithm tuned specifically for projected momentum swings to capture
  ETH or BTC gains, which is to say the ultimate goal is to increase the market value of the set itself.
  Rebalances will vary in size and the asset allocation may sometimes remain static for several days,
  but typically it will change frequently with market conditions
