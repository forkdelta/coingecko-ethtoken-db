description: >-
  LUSD is a fully redeemable USD-pegged stablecoin issued by the Liquity Protocol. Liquity is a decentralized
  borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans
  are paid out in LUSD and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.


  In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow
  borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.


  Liquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.
