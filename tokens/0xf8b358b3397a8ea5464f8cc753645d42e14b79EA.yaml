description: >-
  Airbloc Protocol redefines how data is collected, monetized and utilized. Leveraging blockchain technology
  and token economics, it seeks to facilitate more transparent data flows between data owners, data providers
  and data consumers.


  Ultimately, it aims to return data ownership back to data owners, provide applications with tools to
  collect and monetize data legitimately, and allow data consumers to purchase explicitly consented data
  with an auditable source of provenance for their business intelligence, research, and targeted marketing
  purposes.
