  What is FUZE?

  FUZE Token is a fully community-driven social experiment and the world’s first self-deflationary currency
  with a supply of 1000 tokens and a 5% burn rate.


  Why FUZE?

  A difference between FUZE and most other deflationary projects is that there is no dev holding/allocation
  — every token was distributed fairly by airdrops. This distinguishes FUZE as a token created entirely
  for its community.


  What’s the purpose of the FUZE project?

  Our main goal is to build a community that decides in which direction the FUZE Token should go. Future
  functions or use-cases can be built by any member of the community. Of course, the main function right
  now is the deflationary token model — this means the total supply decreases with each transaction.


  Why a deflationary token?

  We like the concept of this kind of token model because it exemplifies the hodler mentality. Let’s say
  you buy FUZE Tokens for 1 ETH — you are incentivized to hold your FUZE because each time you send it
  to another address, 5% will be burned. This naturally encourages hodling, rather than sending. This
  token burn will naturally drive token appreciation through driving an increase in scarcity vs demand.
