  PolySwarm in 60 Seconds.

  Polyswarm is a decentralized threat intelligence market made possible by Ethereum smart contracts and
  blockchain technology.


  Polyswarm incentivizes rapid innovation in the $8.5B/yr anti-virus and automated cyber threat intelligence
  space with precise economic incentives that reward timely and accurate threat intelligence concerning
  the malintent of files, network traffic and URLs.


  PolySwarm defines a real-time threat detection ecosystem involving enterprises, consumers, vendors and
  geographically-diverse security experts. Experts develop and hone competing “micro-engines” that autonomously
  investigate the latest threats, attempting to outperform their competition. PolySwarm’s “Proof of Work”
  is threat detection accuracy: the market rewards experts who are best able to defend enterprises and
  end users.


  Relative to today’s ad hoc market, PolySwarm will lower the barier to entry, provide broader coverage
  options, discourage duplicative effort and ensure interoperability among products and threat intelligence
  feeds. Economically, PolySwarm functions as a skill-required twist on a prediction market2 with thousands
  of micro-engines (“workers”) investigating the latest in malware evolution at machine speed - no human
  in the loop.


  PolySwarm will be developed by Swarm Technologies, Inc. (“Swarm Technologies”) with funding derived
  from the sale of ERC20-compatible Nectar (“NCT”) utility tokens. As a utility token, PolySwarm economically
  disincentivizes Nectar speculation by rewarding honest market participation through the collection and
  distribution of Fees (details on page 6) to valueadding, active participants.
