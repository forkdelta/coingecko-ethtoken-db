  Rush is an ERC-20 token backed by aggregate quarries to provide stability that is not common among cryptocurrencies.
  While other assets are prone to market volatility, Rush can establish a stable price due to being backed
  by a consistently valued asset.


  Rush is a mintable ERC-20 token which enables the creation of new tokens to be added to the currencyâ€™s
  max supply, while the supply of other ERC-20 tokens is fixed. This function opens up a range of very
  promising possibilities for Rush tokens.
