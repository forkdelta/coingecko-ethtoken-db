  We have developed the Believer network as an open standard that enables instant cryptocurrency payments
  in stores and online. This new network is designed to act as an intermediary between merchants and the
  blockchain, offering them inexpensive and fraud-resistant transactions without volatility exposure.
  Believer enables consumers to pay with their preferred cryptocurrency while preserving their freedom,
  security and data privacy.Believer doesnâ€™t require any physical cards or merchant point-of-sale upgrades.
  Believer was developed from decades of experience in fintech, retail, and payments. Today, Believer
  features many high-profile merchants on its platform, the launch of which marks the first real instance
  of a decentralized, global payment network with the power to make commerce more efficient and accessible
  for billions of people.
