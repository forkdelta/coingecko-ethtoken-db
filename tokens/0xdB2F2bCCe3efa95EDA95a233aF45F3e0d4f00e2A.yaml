description: >-
  Aegis is a scalable DeFi platform that solves this problem by giving users access to lending and unsecured
  borrowing services, based on their credit scores. An "Aegis Score" is then assigned to the individual
  users, which allows users to unlock corresponding capital loans in the crypto ecosystem. Aegis therefore
  plays the critical role of a capital bridge that gives users the ability to leverage and move liquidity
  seamlessly between fiat and crypto ecosystems.
