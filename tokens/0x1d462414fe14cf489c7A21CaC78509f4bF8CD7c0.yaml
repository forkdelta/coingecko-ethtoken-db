description: >-
  CanYa is a peer to peer market of skilled services - where users are instantly connected to service
  providers. Unlike most ICO's we already have a working product, high user growth and an experienced
  team. We launched our initial product to Australia earlier this year and now we're conducting an ICO
  to fund expansion into the international market as well as launching CAN token. CanYa has again raised
  the bar for ICOs following a major acquisition of Bountysource and its passionate 46,000 open-source
  developer community.
