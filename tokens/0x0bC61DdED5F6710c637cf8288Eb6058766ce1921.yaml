  Coinsuper would like to announce our platform token — CEN (Coinsuper Ecosystem Network)’s issuance and
  our plan to set up “Coinsuper Club”, i.e., the Global Advisor Association. All the CEN holders own the
  privilege for premium projects subscription.


  CEN (“Coinsuper Ecosystem Network”) is Coinsuper’s platform token. It is based on the ERC-20 token standard
  and has a total supply of 1 billion tokens, with no further issuance. Coinsuper is committed to building
  a world-class cryptocurrency exchange that drives mainstream and institutional adoption of digital assets.
  Coinsuper’s unique expertise in traditional finance, combined with its technical and operational excellence,
  makes it uniquely qualified to achieve this goal.

  CEN will serve as Coinsuper’s platform token and power a robust cryptocurrency ecosystem that is comprised
  of the Coinsuper exchange, a network of global crypto investors, top crypto investment funds, regulatory
  authorities and blockchain innovation labs. Together, this ecosystem will advance the growth of cryptocurrency
  and strengthen industry regulation and governance.


  Coinsuper has always been committed to creating a compliant and safe trading platform for premium blockchain
  projects, so as to provide global users more opportunities to participate through CEN. With the establishment
  of Coinsuper Club, Coinsuper will invite world-class blockchain investors and consultants who consistently
  refer premium blockchain projects to the platform.


  CEN holders and Coinsuper Club members would enjoy the benefits including:


  a. All CEN holders on the platform can get the opportunities and discounts for early participation in
  premium projects subscriptions;

  b. The platform will also give premium project tokens away to CEN holders on an irregular basis;

  c. Club members would enjoy the priority to get a certain share of premium projects;


  Currently, the first batch Coinsuper Club members including Pantera Capital, 8 Decimal Capital, Node
  Capital, Blockwater Capital and Connect Capital have been invited to join.
