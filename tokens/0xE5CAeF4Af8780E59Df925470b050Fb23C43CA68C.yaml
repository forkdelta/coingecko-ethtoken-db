description: >-
  Ferrum is a DAG-based interoperability network that connects to any blockchain and works natively with
  fiat currencies. Itâ€™s like the Lightning Network but for every blockchain. The advanced financial products
  that run on the network - like our West African fiat gateway (Kudi Exchange) and non-custodial cross-chain
  OTC wallet (UniFyre Wallet) - aim to empower millions of people around the world. Our network and products
  are powered by the FRM token, which is spent and burned with every transaction. And coming in later
  2020, a high-speed cross chain DEX and mobile cold store application.
