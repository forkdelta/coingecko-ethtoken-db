description: >-
  Vey is a near-term, decentralized application that will create a more efficient, profitable and secure
  environment for both consumers and vendors. Taking online surveys will become a fair exchange, where
  survey creators and participants hold significantly more power than third parties. Microscopic fees,
  on a per-survey basis, will put more earnings into the hands of survey takers.


  The role of our platform, in its simplest form, is to match people with the most profitable surveys
  available to them. Creators will have complete control over who takes their survey, and how much it
  pays. On the flip side, participants will have complete ownership over their earnings. This is in stark
  contrast to the current model.
