description: >-
  Butterfly Protocol aim to create a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that will replace the
  DNS system and change the economics of domain ownership. Only by incubating a DAO Registrar with its
  own tokens can we create a lasting self sustaining economy that can replace ICANN. This ability to remove
  people and governments from the central control of the Internet is paramount to create a lasting uncensored
  internet.
