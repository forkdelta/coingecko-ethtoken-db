description: >-
  Cellframe is a quantum-resistant layer-1 network focused on facilitating secure and scalable cross-chain
  transfers. Cellframe aims to create an infrastructure for decentralized low-level services through its
  multichain nature. It is quantum-safe â€” it uses post-quantum encryption by default. Cellframe is built
  from scratch with plain C, which results in more efficient utilization of CPU and memory.
