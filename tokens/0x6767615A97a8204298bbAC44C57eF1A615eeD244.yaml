description: >-
  Cribnb is a decentralized short-term rental ecosystem that will use blockchain technology to make the
  rental process less costly and more convenient and secure. The transparent ecosystem with verified information
  on hosts and guests will foster trust between the parties. Cribnb’s decentralized platform will reduce
  traditional frustrations, scam rates, time delays, and friction points in the rental process to benefit
  both hosts and guests. Thanks to smart contracts, it is now possible to build a truly decentralized
  and automated sharing economy platform. This will be done with no middlemen and thus 0% commission,
  meanwhile sharing the wealth with the users in a two-sided marketplace. Given the growing acceptance
  of the sharing economy and increased usage of digital currencies, Cribnb’s launch comes at a growth
  inflection point for our target market.

  Cribnb will build a smart platform that serves a growing market segment. The platform will develop tools
  that will make the market grow in a more transparent, user-friendly manner. Cribnb will attempt to resolve
  the technological gaps in the current short-term rental platforms. The Cribnb platform will aim to significantly
  improve the user experience within the peer-to-peer rental market by aligning incentives.
