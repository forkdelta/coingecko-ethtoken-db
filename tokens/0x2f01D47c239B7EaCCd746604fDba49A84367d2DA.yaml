  FinCredit Protocol (FIC) is a decentralized application protocol that is building a secure and efficient
  decentralized credit reference network with blockchain technology. It provides credit attestations and
  credit inquiry services for both lenders and borrowers, and resolves the problems of data authenticity
  and lack of credit system in the traditional lending industry, so as to realize its ultimate vision
  of quick and easy financial services both locally and globally.


  The FIC team has taken root in FinTech for years, with core members mostly from Alibaba, UnionPay, Ant
  Financial, PingAn, etc. FIC’s SaaS platform has been officially implemented at the end of 2018. According
  to test results, it can effectively reduce users’ borrowing costs and default rate.

  The project is powerfully backed by FinTech and real economy, with stable profit models that are sufficient
  to support its development and operations. It will gradually connect on-chain & off-chain businesses,
  and provide incremental funds to the market.

  FinCredit Protocol has partnered with multiple blockchain wallets such as Qbao and Token Panda, and
  previously received strategic investments from BN Capital, Dr.J Labs, Evernew Capital, Unknown Labs,
  Amedeo Capital, Jove Capital, QbaoNetwork Foundation, etc.
