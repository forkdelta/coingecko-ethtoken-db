description: "\"Era Swap Token (ES) (a decentralized utility token) currently based on Ethereum blockchain\
  \ (ERC20) will be used on multiple platforms for exchange of services (P2P), avail discounts, get rewards\
  \ and many more utility. Era Swap (ES) is an ER20 token which is supported by Era Swap Ecosystem. ES\
  \ can be used within this ecosystem for discounts and rewards to users. Era Swap Ecosystem (ESE) consists\
  \ of multiple utility platforms for day to day life such as P2P Social Marketplace, Education, Charity,\
  \ Prediction, Multi Exchange Solution, P2P Lend & Borrow, Decentralized Wallet, Affiliate Program, Token\
  \ Vesting, Merchants & Shoppers etc.  Please refer white paper for detailed road map https://eraswaptoken.io/pdf/eraswap_whitepaper.pdf\n\
  The utility of ES comes because of ease of access and smart contract driven reward distribution for\
  \ transparency. Further these rewards can be redeemed back by the users within the ecosystem. Era Swap\
  \ Ecosystem includes multiple interlinked platforms as below:\n\tTimeAlly DApp – Set of smart contract\
  \ driven token vesting platform which rewards the community for vesting. TimeAlly also acts as the foundation\
  \ for reward distribution to the community members based on their contribution within the ecosystem.\n\
  \tBetDeEx DApp – BetDeEx is a decentralized Prediction Platform where users can predict and win. BetDeEx\
  \ leverages blockchain to make the overall prediction process Decentralized, Transparent, and Trustless.\n\
  \tEra Swap Academy– a self-paced eLearning app to learn blockchain technology at an affordable cost\
  \ with the scope to add next-gen frontline technologies like IOT, AI, ML, AR and VR.\n\tTime Swappers\
  \ –A p2p social marketplace where users will be rewarded for sharing original contents as well ascan\
  \ exchange services.\n\tEra Swap Wallet – A decentralized and secured wallet with HD wallet.\n\tBuzCafe–\
  \ is a retail network where community can transact in P2P mode by meeting up and exchanging product\
  \ or services.\n\tSwappers Wall – a social platform integrated with marketplace to make users more\
  \ comfortable by exchanging services with their community members in P2P mode, powered by Power Token\

  \ by SSO (Single Sign-On) through a unique affiliate program Day Swappers who will further add more\
  \ users to multiple platforms by referring their community and get rewarded based on their contribution.\n\
  Problem Statement:\nThe internet phenomenon made it extremely convenient to match the asset owner and\
  \ asset seeker however internet itself cannot power the transaction in a decentralized way. There have\
  \ been multiple platforms for buyers and sellers across the globe however there are few elementary problems\
  \ with traditional centralized platforms:\n\n•\tLack affordable learning platforms exclusively for high\
  \ end technologies\n•\tLack of Self paced learning applications where millineal from remote area can\
  \ learn technology, anytime anywhere through mobile or web\n•\tLack of awareness among coming generation\
  \ about the dynamic nature of technology and its insurgence in daily life\n•\tLack of aggregators model\
  \ which connects teachers/subject matter expert with knowledge seeker/ students worldwide without any\
  \ barrier\n•\tLack of social platforms which rewards users as well as their circle for their contribution\
  \ in peer to peer mode for exchange of services\n•\tFreelance platforms charge about 10-30% fees per\
  \ transaction as middlemen.\n•\tGlobal payment gateways charge between 30% to 40% for processing payment\
  \ transaction\n•\tTraditional Banking charges are between 2- 3% \n• For doing the transaction, need\
  \ several trusted parties and there is a cost to each trusted party.\n• Users have no control over their\
  \ data which can be further misused by these middlemen.\n• No profit is shared with the users by these\
  \ existing traditional platforms.\nSolution approach\nThe team is working on the solution to solve this\
  \ problem for buyers & sellers. The team designed the concept to create ecosystem altogether multiple\
  \ interlinked platforms which make the ecosystem self sustainable and not dependent on any third party.\
  \ Here users communicate in transparent P2P mode to exchange their requirements on day to day basis.\
  \ Team is focused on simplifying the offerings with user friendly solutions which can be used easily\
  \ by any common man and doesn’t requires much tech savvy knowledge to operate.\nApart from this we have\
  \ a team of 30 plus software developers day in & day out working to make better solutions for community\""
