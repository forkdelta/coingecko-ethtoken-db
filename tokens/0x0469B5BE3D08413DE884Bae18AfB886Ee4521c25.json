Among them, the data layer encapsulates the underlying data blocks and related basic data and algorithms such as data encryption and timestamp; the network layer includes distributed networking mechanism, data dissemination mechanism and data validation mechanism; the consensus layer encapsulates all kinds of consensus algorithms of network nodes; and the incentive layer integrates economic factors into the block chain technology system, including economic incentives. The contract layer encapsulates all kinds of scripts, algorithms and intelligent contracts, which is the basis of block chain programmability. The application layer encapsulates all kinds of application scenarios and cases of block chain.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"huotop","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9744/large/htp.PNG?1571364643","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9744/small/htp.PNG?1571364643","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9744/thumb/htp.PNG?1571364643"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x0469b5be3d08413de884bae18afb886ee4521c25"],"homepage":["https://huotop.cc/"]},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"HuoTop","public_interest_score":0.993,"symbol":"htp","tickers":[{"base":"HTP","market":{"identifier":"digifinex","name":"Digifinex"},"target":"USDT"}]}
