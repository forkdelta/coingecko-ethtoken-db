description: >-
  TopBidder is a radical auction protocol based on NonFungible Token standards. It adopts the theory of
  Radical Market and implements a non-permanent owned crypto assetsâ€™ (Radical NFT, referred to as rNFT)
  production and auction mechanism.


  Whenever someone bids, the last bidder can get 30% of the price difference with the current bid as subsidy,
  the other 18% of the price difference will go to the pool reserve and the revenue will be distributed
  once a week through BID token yield farming, and 2% will be the inviter reward, 50% will paid to the
  artist.


  For artists who have passed platform certification to issue rNFTs, the bidders will have the opportunity
  to get BIDs for each bid.
