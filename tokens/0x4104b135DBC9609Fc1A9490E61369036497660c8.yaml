description: >-
  APWine is a protocol to trade future yield. DeFi user can deposit their interest bearing tokens of other
  protocols during defined future periods and trade in advance the future yield that their funds will
  generate.


  APWine tokenises the future yield leveraging two types of tokens in that process:

  Future Yield Tokens (FYT) (ERC20): They represent the future yield generated by an asset on one platform
  for a defined period. For example, one 30D-AAVE-ADAI-0 represents the yield generated by 1 ADAI (a.k.a.
  one DAI deposited on AAVE) during the first 30 days period. APWine features a dedicated exchange for
  users to sell and buy FYTs.


  APWINE IBT (ERC20): The APWine interest bearing token. At any moment its holder can withdraw the corresponding
  depositing funds from the APWine protocol. APWINE IBT holders will receive an amount of FYT proportional
  of to the amount they hold (for the future the ibt corresponds to). One 30D-AAVE-ADAI represents one
  ADAI deposited to the ""30D-AAVE-DAI"" future.
