description: "Aave is a decentralized lending platform that runs on <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\
  >Ethereum</a> Network which offers secure, peer-to-peer lending Smart Contracts. Aave strives to break\
  \ through the traditional bank loans system with a more efficient solution. Aave also uniquely allows\
  \ a borrower and a lender to decide on important loan details that can eliminate the need of a middle\
  \ man. Due to the elimination of middlemen, process fee for a loan does not exist on this platform.\
  \ This provide convenience to any lender and borrower to create loans on their agreed terms. Decentralized\
  \ lending has fixed many issues and one of the reasons why is the transparency of loan.\n\nThe Ethereum\
  \ network provides a transparent ledger where all transactions are available to be inspected. Secondly,\
  \ it isn’t necessary to find a trusted loan provider because all collateral which is the digital asset\
  \ for loans are stored and locked in a smart contract and broadcasted on the public ethereum blockchain.\
  \ It is also flexible for borrower to manage the collateral by refilling or withdrawing part of it.\
  \ Borrower may make such changes when the lender is notified and aware of such movement. If the lender\
  \ finds out that the action is not communicated, the lender is allowed to initiate a margin call. \n\
  \nThis year, Aave has made a major upgrades in its Q1 2018. They have deployed the new development for\
  \ their peer-to-peer lending application named Alpha 0.3. The development process of Alpha 0.3 has started\
  \ since the early of 2017. The new release also includes a completely new user interface which targets\
  \ to lower the learning curve of user experience on the app. Furthermore, the new user interface has\
  \ new sections to make lending process simpler such as including a ‘My Loan’ section, collectible badges\
  \ and more. Other than that, the team is also in the process of developing more updates for the smart\
  \ contracts. Hence, the team has decided to provide zero-fee lending with the use of LEND token as a\
  \ medium of exchange, as an alternative to borrowing in Ethereum. The purpose of this is to provide\
  \ a cross-blockchain lending currency which will prompt users to use LEND as the medium of exchange."
