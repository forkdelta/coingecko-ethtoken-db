Qripplex is giving out a great opportunity for new crypto users, crypto enthusiats and absolutely anyone to own and make use of cryptocurrency.\n\nTo explain further, Qripplex is an ERC20 token standard built on the ethereum blockchain and thus, it uses a peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority, store house or banks to manage transactions or the likes. Transactions made are  carried out collectively on the blockchain. There is no central control over PPL. Qripplex is open source, community driven, and decentralized, anyone is welcome.\n\nQripplex tends to make its community globally adopted and also allow the use of PPL in real-life applications. We are striving to make Qripplex available in many sectors, but primarily the ecommerce sector, to make PPL widely in use to make payments for any purchase in the sector.
