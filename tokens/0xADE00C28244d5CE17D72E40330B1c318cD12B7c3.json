The original roadmap anticipated a beta release in February 2018. It remains to be seen if the team will meet that deadline. Future plans for version two of AdEx after launch focus on improving the user experience and scalability. AdEx has also expressed an interest in implementing a real-time bidding solution that could take place off-chain or on a high throughput network, like IOTA. AdEx raised $10 million in the first three hours of token sale.\n\nAdEx as a platform has room for a good amount of growth since digital advertising is a booming business anyway. But by eliminating flaws and continuing updates on its current platform, AdEx aims to stand firm in the near future.","developer_score":51.053,"id":"adex","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/847/large/adex.png?1547034643","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/847/small/adex.png?1547034643","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/847/thumb/adex.png?1547034643"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1965467,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xADE00C28244d5CE17D72E40330B1c318cD12B7c3","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xADE00C28244d5CE17D72E40330B1c318cD12B7c3"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/nMBGJsb"],"homepage":["https://www.adex.network/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-market","https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-platform","https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-protocol","https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-protocol-eth","https://github.com/AdExNetwork/adex-validator"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AdEx","twitter_screen_name":"AdEx_Network"},"liquidity_score":31.612,"market_cap_rank":320,"name":"AdEx","public_interest_score":0.16,"symbol":"adx","tickers":[{"base":"ADXN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ADXN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"ADXN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"USD"}]}
