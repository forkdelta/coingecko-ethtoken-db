  Dubler token is a digital exchange currency based on Ethereum algorithm blockchain. It is a peer to
  peer cryptocurrency. Dubler token can be sent directly between two parties via the use of private and
  public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep
  fees charged by traditional financial institutions.


  DublerToken aims to create a new kind of Cryptocurrency, powered by blockchain technology. On this new
  era, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Today, there is a seemingly
  infinite supply of digital books, movies, music and games.


  But people do not necessarily own their digital property. You can purchase a digital book, for example,
  but you canâ€™t sell it to anyone else. So, do you really own it? DublerToken wants to make digital assets
  scarce, identifiable and tradable. Property rights pave the way for wealth creation, and DBT intends
  to build a new World Wide Web.it is a successful project by hardworking of the owner of this project
  Logan s Parez and his our team.
