  Rebased is a fork of the recently hyped Ampleforth project – with clear and required changes.


  We have given REB the ability to adjust its supply equally and automatically in response to changes
  in demand – in a trustless environment where code is law.


  The goal of Rebased is to reach its desired price target of 1 USD. To achieve this there is the so-called
  Rebase, which adjusts the supply to the demand.


  All supply changes apply equally to every owner/wallet holing REB. Your balance changes but you always
  own the same % of the total supply. Your holdings increase in value as the market cap of REB grows.


  Imagine yourself in a world where the ECB or FED prints some billions again and you receive “new” money
  directly on your bank account. Sounds like a dream? Well not in crypto. Welcome to the world of Rebased.
