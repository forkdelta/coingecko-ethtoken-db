  A True Payable Token Built For Commerce

  There Is No Way To Execute Code After An ERC-20 Transfer Or Approval (I.E. Making A Payment), So To
  Make An Action It Is Required To Send Another Transaction And Pay GAS Twice. EthereumPay Makes Token
  Payments Easier And Working Without The Use Of Any Other Listener. It Allows To Make A Callback After
  A Transfer Or Approval In A Single Transaction.
