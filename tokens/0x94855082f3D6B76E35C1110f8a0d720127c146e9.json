It is a peer to peer cryptocurrency. Dubler token can be sent directly between two parties via the use of private and public keys. These transfers can be done with minimal processing fees, allowing users to avoid the steep fees charged by traditional financial institutions.\n\nDublerToken aims to create a new kind of Cryptocurrency, powered by blockchain technology. On this new era, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Today, there is a seemingly infinite supply of digital books, movies, music and games.\n\nBut people do not necessarily own their digital property. You can purchase a digital book, for example, but you can\u2019t sell it to anyone else. So, do you really own it? DublerToken wants to make digital assets scarce, identifiable and tradable. Property rights pave the way for wealth creation, and DBT intends to build a new World Wide Web.it is a successful project by hardworking of the owner of this project Logan s Parez and his our team.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"dubler-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10116/large/TZQJ4A-q_400x400.jpg?1575966833","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10116/small/TZQJ4A-q_400x400.jpg?1575966833","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10116/thumb/TZQJ4A-q_400x400.jpg?1575966833"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@dublernetwork/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x94855082f3d6b76e35c1110f8a0d720127c146e9"],"facebook_username":"dublerDBT","homepage":["https://dub-ler.com/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"dublerDBT","twitter_screen_name":"DbtDubler"},"liquidity_score":0.0,"market_cap_rank":3746,"name":"Dubler Token","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"dbt","tickers":[{"base":"DBT","market":{"identifier":"vindax","name":"Vindax"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"DBT","market":{"identifier":"vindax","name":"Vindax"},"target":"ETH"}]}
