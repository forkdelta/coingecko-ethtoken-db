  ABLE is a financial platform of cryptocurrency. ABLE’s P2P loan matching engine and DEX based mutual
  fund platform solve current tradition banking and investing problem. Blockchain technology enable to
  connect global investors and entrepreneurs regardless of border in a reliable way.


  The ABLE project has been proposed to provide an alternative to banks’ conventional lendingdeposit spread
  structure, and to solve problems with initial cryptocurrency banking services.


  By developing a matching engine that connects investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer basis, the project
  directly connects investors and borrowers without any intermediaries. With intermediaries and lending
  spreads eliminated, cryptocurrency interest rates will be determined by mutual agreement between users
  in a free market, and said rates will serve as market interest rates. Investors can receive higher interests
  than they would in a centralized market, while borrowers can lend money at lower rates, creating a win-win
  scenario. Since investing and lending occur governed by smart contracts, the project will eliminate
  exposure to managers’ moral hazard and the risk of central-server hacking.


  Current cryptocurrency banking services provide deposits and loans separately rather than linking depositors
  and borrowers. The services have shortcomings such as inability to provide high deposit interest rates
  in a sustainable way. Such services cannot mitigate or eliminate intermediary risks because their structure
  is based on a centralized model. On the other hand, the ABLE project directly links users, primarily
  through an account, and enables a variety of financial activities such as payroll and investment, based
  on smart contracts.


  The ABLE project primarily aims to apply decentralized blockchain technology to financial and wealth
  management features; to directly link demand and supply through an account on a peer-to-peer basis;
  and to establish a reliable system. It aims subsequently to build an in-house decentralized exchange,
  and then to evolve into a platform on which to develop and use smart contracts for finance and wealth
  management services.
