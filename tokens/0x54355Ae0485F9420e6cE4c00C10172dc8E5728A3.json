While it can have longer periods of deeper underperformance vs USD, it's fine tuned to be less volatile when measured in ETH. Crypto investors who are positive about ETH future and want to multiply ETH stash, should choose this strategy. It uses DAI, which is more decentralised than USDC and yields no interest, therefore it's well suited for investors who prefer not to invest in cUSDC for religious reasons.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"100-waves-ethusd-ether-hoard-set","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11645/large/100_waves_ethusd.png?1592323395","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11645/small/100_waves_ethusd.png?1592323395","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11645/thumb/100_waves_ethusd.png?1592323395"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/set-protocol"],"blockchain_site":["https://www.etherscan.io/address/0x54355ae0485f9420e6ce4c00c10172dc8e5728a3"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/x3PGVfP"],"homepage":["https://www.tokensets.com/set/100weth"],"twitter_screen_name":"SetProtocol"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"100 Waves ETH/USD Ether Hoard Set","public_interest_score":0.016,"symbol":"100weth","tickers":[{"base":"0X54355AE0485F9420E6CE4C00C10172DC8E5728A3","market":{"identifier":"token_sets","name":"TokenSets"},"target":"USD"}]}
