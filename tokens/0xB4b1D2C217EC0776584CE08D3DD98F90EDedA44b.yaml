  Climate Blockchain Initiatives is a disruptive financial ecosystem that aims to promote and drive funds
  towards enterprises that are showing their commitment to climate change mitigation.

  Its trading platform, Climatetrade, is a decentralised carbon credits marketplace that uses blockchain
  technology to allow corporations and individuals worldwide to compensate their emissions, and project
  developers to generate additional income and revenue stream based on their performance in terms of carbon
  dioxide reductions.


  The Climatetrade technology uses the Climatecoin (CO2 Token), a cryptographic utility asset aimed to
  work as trading currency for certified carbon credits, allowing seamless, fast and efficient trading
  operations, while at the same time resolving the problem of macro and micro cross country payments.
