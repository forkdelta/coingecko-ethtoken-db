Providing a Global Betting Liquidity Pool, BETR is being built by gaming industry veterans, for the industry. BETR will become the exclusive crypto-currency of some of the world's leading gaming operators.\n\nThe online betting industry has lacked innovative ideas for some time. Odds are massively in favour of the bookmaker, payment methods are outdated and regularly winning players are restricted or banned. There is a lack of security, lack of privacy, extortionate fees and low returns, all of which are factors which either put bettors off or drive them to underground betting.\n\nBETR is different. It is the betting crypto-currency that will establish truly decentralised sports betting on the internet. With BETR providing financial security true peer-to-peer betting becomes possible on the internet with entities that have no prior relationship. Using blockchain we are able to provide sportsbook clients that operate with no human or business entity in the middle. The system is safe, the software and transactions are provably fair and robust and payment is simple. The BETR token is the future of betting.","developer_score":12.0,"id":"betterbetting","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4065/large/betterbetting.png?1547039212","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4065/small/betterbetting.png?1547039212","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4065/thumb/betterbetting.png?1547039212"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x763186eb8d4856d536ed4478302971214febc6a9","https://etherscan.io/token/0x763186eb8d4856d536ed4478302971214febc6a9","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x763186eb8d4856d536ed4478302971214febc6a9"],"facebook_username":"BETRBetting","homepage":["https://www.betterbetting.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/BetterBetting/Contracts"]},"twitter_screen_name":"BETRBetting"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":1221,"name":"BetterBetting","public_interest_score":38.338,"symbol":"betr","tickers":[{"base":"BETR","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"BETR","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"BETR","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"BETR","market":{"identifier":"latoken","name":"LATOKEN"},"target":"ETH"}]}
