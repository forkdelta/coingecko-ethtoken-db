  Wabi ecosystem connects Brands and Consumers, enabling a seamless, fair, and confidential exchange of
  value and information.


  Consumers participating in the ecosystem take advantage of the several tools designed to better inform
  their consumption choices and are incentivized with Wabi. Consumers redeem the tokens at a dedicated
  Marketplace where they can purchase thousands of unique products delivered to them from across the globe.


  Participating Brands leverage Wabi tokens to obtain unique datasets on consumer behaviour allowing them
  to make superior marketing and strategic decisions. Moreover, the Brands incentivise users with Wabi
  to generate new data, thus enabling rapid hypothesis testing and iteration. Effectively, Wabi taps into
  corporate marketing budgets ($1.6 â€“ $1.9 trillion annually), making marketing a lot more efficient for
  participating companies.



  What is WABI tokenomics?

  With growth of the ecosystem the circulating supply is reduced since for every point issued to consumers
  one WABI get taken out of the circulation. As of 16 November 2020, over 3,000,000 WABI have been locked
  out of circulation with growth of the WABI ecosystem. You can track the daily stats at www.wabi.io


  Wabi was founded in 2013 by Alex Busarov and Yaz Belinskiy. The two founders first met in high school
  and after studying at the London School of Economics pursued careers in consulting at McKinsey and Bain
  respectively. Having worked on several important cases in the Consumer Goods industry, the two became
  convinced that there should be a more effective way to do marketing and that the inefficiencies in the
  FMCG industry that often resulted in public health risk were completely solvable with technology and
  determination.
