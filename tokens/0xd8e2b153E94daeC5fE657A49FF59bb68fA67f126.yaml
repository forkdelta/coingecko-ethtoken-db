  "UK based and founded in 2018, FRED Energy aims to promote and facilitate greater adoption and generation
  of alternative energy by consumers and Fund Research into Energy Devices (FRED). Rising energy costs,
  fuel poverty, and access to support and funding for energy device innovators are some of the problems
  FRED Energy aims to help solve. Development of green energy related projects and an eco focussed marketplace
  that went live in Q1 2020, shop.fredenergy.org is one of the earliest adoptors of crypto payments for
  real world products.


  Further projects scheduled for 2021 include a JV product development with battery pack tracking to enable
  reuse and recycling on the Stellar blockchain using our token FACT, a non-tradeable token.


  The project launched FREDx on the Ethereum blockchain in January 2021 in an effort to increase awareness
  and liquidity of its green energy related projects making FRED Energy a dual blockchain project."
