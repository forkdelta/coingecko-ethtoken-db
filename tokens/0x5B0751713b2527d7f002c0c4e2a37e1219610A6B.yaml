  Ethorse is an Ethereum Smart Contract based DApp for betting on the price of Cryptocurrencies and win
  from everyone who bets against you. Users bet on a coin/token that performs the best among all the other
  competing ones in a specific time period. Bets are placed and rewards are claimed using Metamask plugin
  for Chrome/Firefox or the Ethereum based Mist browser. Being completely secured by the blockchain, no
  one has control over the race or user funds once a contract is deployed and a race is announced
