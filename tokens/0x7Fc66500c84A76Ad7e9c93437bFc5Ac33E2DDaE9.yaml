description: >-
  Aave is a decentralized money market protocol where users can lend and borrow cryptocurrency across
  20 different assets as collateral. The protocol has a native token called AAVE, which is also a governance
  token that lets the community decide the direction of the protocol in a collective manner. Lenders canÂ earn
  interest by providing liquidity to the market, while borrowers can borrow by collateralizing their cryptoassets
  to take out loans from the liquidity pools.
