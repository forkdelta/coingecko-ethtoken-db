  Decentraland is an Ethereum-powered virtual reality platform. In this virtual world, you purchase plots
  of land that you can later traverse, build upon, and monetize. There’s no limit to what you can do.
  It’s the first digital platform that’s completely owned by its users. Similar to games like Skyrim and
  Fallout, Decentraland is an all-immersive virtual universe. However, instead of playing on a 2-dimensional
  screen, you participate in a 3-dimensional world. It seems to be the logical next step before creating
  full-blown AI-based games in the physical space à la Westworld. Similar groupings on LAND comprise Districts.
  Districts are basically communities that revolve around a shared theme. For example, there may be a
  District just for crypto enthusiasts with cryptocurrency apps and services.


  The Decentraland team is led by Ari Meilich (Project Lead) and Esteban Ordano (Tech Lead). Ordano previously
  worked at <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a> as a software engineer and founded Smart Contract
  Solutions, Inc. Both founders have also worked together in creating Stremium and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcore">Bitcore</a>.
  Decentraland has been around for longer than you may think. The team hit their first development milestone,
  Stone Age, in June 2015. This was a simple, pixelated grid that allocated pixels to users through a
  proof-of-work algorithm. Most recently, they held a Terraform Event in which they sold LAND in the new,
  3D world. The team has also partnered with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x">district0x</a>,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon">Aragon</a>, and imToken to provide some of their
  services.


  MANA is the token used to buy lands in Decentraland. The Blockchain platform can be incorporated in
  order to buy or sell the various digital assets available in the virtual world. An unclaimed land would
  have the same market pricing on every exchange possible and precisely the developers are on a hunt for
  such since as they can build on top of it, and attract lot of popularity. However, one must keep in
  mind that the land parcels are different from them and each one of them varies according to the various
  market conditions of that time. Mana can be a great investment and can be bought by trading and with
  other <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>, <a href"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>,
  or any other prominent cryptocurrency and on some of the most notable cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/huobi">Huobi</a>
  are two of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that one can suggest for trading Mana tokens.


  The Decentraland coin isn’t a minable cryptocurrency as it is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, unlike
  Bitcoin and other similar currencies. So users looking to engage in some Decentraland mining will be
  disappointed. Instead, it was sold during token sales and is now being traded on exchanges.
