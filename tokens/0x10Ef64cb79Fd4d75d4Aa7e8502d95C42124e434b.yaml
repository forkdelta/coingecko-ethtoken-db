description: >-
  This is a decentralized contribution to the original NCOV investment community., where all coins purchased
  by the market makers will be recorded as “burned” on “burn days.” Each burn day will have a minimum
  burn of total deaths and fatalities, but no maximum number, whereby market makers can buy as much as
  the market affords. The total number of bought coins will be recorded for each of the burn days, where
  investors can be guaranteed that the minimum will be purchased until the .0000001 price point is achieved.
