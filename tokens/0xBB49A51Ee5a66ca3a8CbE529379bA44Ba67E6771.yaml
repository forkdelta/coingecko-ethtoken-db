  to mine cryptocurrencies, in two different variants to optimize profitability, as well as being able
  to self-supply the farm with our own energy, coming from a solar photovoltaic plant, installed in Spain,
  this energy can also be distributed as a service for electric companies.


  Cryptosolartech is a ERC-20 type token that will work on the Blockchain of Ethereum. The CST Token is
  classified as a Utility token, so all owners will have rights of use over the assets acquired, and may
  request their exploitation and use at the time they require it.


  In cryptosolartech we develop cryptocurrency mining, sustained with renewable energy, obtaining our
  own with the help of 3.000 equipments, thus mining in two different variants to optimize profitability.
  In addition we can self-supply the farm with our own energy from a photovoltaic plant installed in the
  province of Seville (Spain), this energy can also be distributed as a service for electricity companies.


  During the Cryptosolartech ICO, we will obtain our own cryptocurrencies, in a farm where we will install
  3.000 equipments to mine cryptocurrencies, in two different variants to optimize profitability, as well

  The Ethereum public Blockchain will be used for the management, generation of income and start-up of
  the physical assets that make up this project. The objective of this ICO is therefore, to create a mining
  farm of cryptocurrencies and a photovoltaic plant of solar panels to generate electricity. In order
  to participate in the project, only digital tokens can be purchased that will go on sale to register
