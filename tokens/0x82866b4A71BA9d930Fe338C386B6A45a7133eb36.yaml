description: >-
  QCORE is a non-inflationary cryptocurrency that is designed to execute profit-generating strategies
  autonomously with a completely decentralized approach. In existing autonomous strategy-executing platforms
  a team or single developer is solely responsible for determining how locked funds are used to generate
  ROI. This is hazardous to the health of the fund as it grows, as it creates flawed incentives, and invites
  mistakes to be made. QCORE does away with this dynamic and instead opts for one with decentralized governance.
