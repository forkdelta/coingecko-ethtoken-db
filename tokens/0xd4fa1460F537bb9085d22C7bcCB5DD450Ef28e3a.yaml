  Populous is a peer-to-peer invoice platform founded in 2017 at a high point in the blockchain and cryptocurrency
  craze. It makes use of blockchain's distributed ledger technology to provide a global trading platform
  for invoice financing. According to the Populous website, "invoice finance is a form of funding that
  instantly unlocks the cash tied up in outstanding sales invoices. Business owners allow invoice buyers
  to buy invoices at a discounted rate in order to unlock their cash quicker. Once invoices are paid by
  the invoice debtor, the invoice buyer receives the amount previously agreed upon."


  In order to offer funds to invoice sellers, Populous maintains a Liquidity Pool. This is tied in with
  the Populous cryptocurrency (PPT). An investor securitizes PPT by making an initial purchase. PPT is
  then held in escrow as collateral throughout the process. Transactions between invoice buyers and sellers
  take place with Pokens, exchanged for PPT and used as the currency for buying and selling invoices,
  either drawing from or contributing to the Liquidity Pool in the process. As a result of this built-in
  liquidity component, Populous at this point requires no transaction fees. In fact, the only fees levied
  are those associated with late payments. Populous invoice transactions can cover a huge array of industries,
  including many which are not typically available to traditional financing companies.


  The PPT tokens not released during the ICO were retained by the founding and development team. PPT can
  either be held or used as collateral to invest in Populous invoices. In exchange for collateralizing,
  you’re given an amount of Pokens based on a percentage of market value. Currently it’s the lesser of
  50%, or a 30 day market average. These are automatically used to purchase an invoice. If the invoice
  is repaid, you receive both your PPT investment and Pokens profit.
