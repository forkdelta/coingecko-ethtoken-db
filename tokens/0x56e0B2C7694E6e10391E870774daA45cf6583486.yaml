description: >-
  DUO a dual-class token structure that, combined with smart contract governed rules and market arbitrage
  mechanism, provides principal-guaranteed fixed incomes and leveraged capital gains for holders of each
  class, respectively.


  Class A Token also known as the Income Token, continuously accumulates interests based on its original
  net value at last Reset event. It will also receive token payments at each Reset event.

  Class B Token also known as the Leverage Token, entitles leveraged participation of the underlying digital
  assets.

  The Custodian smart contract performs multiple tasks that facilitate key mechanism of the system, including:
  creation and redemption of DUO tokens, safekeeping the underlying digital assets (e.g. ETH), calculation
  of tokensâ€™ net values, and execution of Reset events.
