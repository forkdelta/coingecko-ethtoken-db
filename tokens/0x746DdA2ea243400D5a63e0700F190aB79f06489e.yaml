description: >-
  The BOS platform project was started in late 2016, and has undergone a major change in technical governance
  and direction in early 2018. From 2019, We intend to set our course to the original white paperat the
  time of the ICO with a new brand name called BOSAGORA.


  BOSAGORA came from the word “BOS” and “AGORA” combined together, which shows the true birth of democracy.


  BOSAGORA aims toward more democratic and productive decision-making process with a blockchain implementation.
