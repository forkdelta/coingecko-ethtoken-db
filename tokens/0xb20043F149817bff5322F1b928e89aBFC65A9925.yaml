  EXRT Network is a highly scalable innovative blockchain

  that is developed to support & secure ecosystem of decentralized crosschain applications.


  Fast Finality

  Sub-second block times ensure high throughput (1,000 TPS - 100,000 TPS) needed for EXRNchain crosschain
  ecosystem and massive scalability for smart contracts and DApps.


  Decentralized Applications

  EXRT VM is based on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) codebase which allows for support of reliable decentralized
  applications and cross-blockchain DApps (running on EXRNchain).


  Innovative Consensus Algorithm

  EXRT Network is exploring different consensus algorithms (DPOS, Threshold Relay, Tendermint, Casper
  POS) and will be based on the most secure and reliable of them (after sufficient amount of testing).


  Crosschain Interoperability
