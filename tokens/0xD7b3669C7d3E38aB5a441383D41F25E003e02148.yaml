  Seal is a blockchain powered product authentication and services platform which will provide consumers
  and manufacturers with product trust. Seal enables anyone the ability to confidently, quickly and economically
  verify the authenticity of any product which is Seal enabled.


  Seal is the best way for anyone to check if a product is genuine or fake. Seal combines NFC chips, which
  are embedded into physical products, the Seal app, and the Seal Network to provide a fast, simple, and
  secure way to provide products authenticity and other services. By facilitating a secure tokenized version
  of a physical product, Seal allows product-specific services to operate such as transferring ownership,
  theft prevention, insurance, but also brand activation campaigns and product analytics. Seal lets brands
  earn money every time their products change owners. For the first time in history, brands can earn money
  from items sold through the secondhand trade, while simultaneously protecting their markets from counterfeiters.
  Using the power of the blockchain, authenticity can be checked and ownership can be transferred decades
  from now, even if the product itself is discontinued, as long as people contribute to the decentralized
  Seal network.


  Seal Network is designed for adoption by brands. Its business model allows brands to charge fees for
  services. For the first time in history, brands can earn money from items sold through the secondhand
  trade, while simultaneously protecting their markets from counterfeiters. Every time products change
  hands, the brand earns a fee, turning their products into revenue streams. This offsets the costs of
  equipping the products with

  NFC-chips while providing a lucrative revenue stream where brand monetizes their authenticity. By using
  the power of the blockchain, authenticity can be checked and ownership can be transferred decades from
  now, even if the product itself is discontinued, as long as people contribute to the decentralized Seal
  network.
