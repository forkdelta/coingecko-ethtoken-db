description: >-
  Lever Network enables lending and borrowing using smart contracts which are open source. Lever Network
  does not take custody of tokens and is only a peer to peer marketplace for lenders and borrowers. Lever
  Network uses partner exchanges (Uniswap and Sushi Exchange) for placing a trade. There is a gas delegation
  fee which the platform might charge on some or all of the transactions. This is only to reimburse the
  relayers the charge of relaying the transaction onto the blockchain.
