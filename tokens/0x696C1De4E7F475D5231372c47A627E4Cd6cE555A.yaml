description: >-
  IMPULSE is a high frequency algorithm for market making on the ETH/USD pair via the Bybit exchange platform
  guaranteed by an erc20 token and decentralized finance on Uniswap. It is designed to evolve organically
  without private and/or public selling and intelligent capital management. Every day, the Bybit account
  buys the IMPULSE tokens directly from the Uniswap pool. The price of the token is thus increasing according
  to the performance of the algorithm. This means that your IMPULSE investment can increase in value even
  if no one buys at a higher price than you.
