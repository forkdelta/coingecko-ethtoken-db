  our unit of payment, based on Ethereum’s blockchain platform.

  needs. VIKKY token is usable worldwide – Use it to pay, exchange on Crypto trading sites, or exchange
  into your preferred fiat currency.


  VIKKY token is going to be issued with a limited amount, therefore, once VIKKY token spread globally,
  its value will multiply rapidly, producing a large profit for investors.


  Vikky is an application that allows you to advertise short term jobs, displaying locations on the map
  from chores such as electricity and water repairs, houses, gardening, etc. to deliver goods from one
  place to another.

  Vikky draws on a route map that connects the departure and destination (such as the itinerary), allowing
  the recipient to easily find a task suitable to their flight. Or a carrier could get more goods on the
  way to their destination.

  Vikky also allows users to filter by industry category of interest, or by language of use. Just change
  the language, for example to Chinese, the Chinese community in the world will see each other regardless
  of geographic location. This also helps communities to be separated, and not messing up together. Users
  only need to choose the work nearby which suits themselves, apply for it and wait for the response of
  the employers. When both sides have agreed, the work will be carried out. Workers receive their earnings
  when work is completed.


  Worker or outsourcer information is valued by the community, which enhances the reputation of the employer
  and the poster, contributing to the reduction of false or fraudulent information. However, only individuals
  who have traded through Vikky can judge the others, this is the way to avoid phony assessment. Participants
  in Vikky are very diverse: from ordinary housewives, students, students, engineers, mechanics, to companies
  that need to recruit short-term workers, and even those who travel, long-distance truck drivers, and
  even Uber, Grab drivers. Airbnb's owners can also hire a cleaner with Vikky. Or guests of Airbnb can
  also rent bicycles, find guides, etc. through Vikky.
