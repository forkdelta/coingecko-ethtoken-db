description: >-
  Daiquilibrium (DAIQ) is an algorithmic stablecoin forked from code written by the Empty Set Dollar (ESD)
  and Dynamic Det Dollar (DSD) devs.Weâ€™ve implemented a few custom features with original code, as well
  as a redesigned bootstrapping method which gives everyone the opportunity to buy at the same price,
  maximally reflexive to demand.
