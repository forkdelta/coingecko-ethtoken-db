  WePower enables renewable energy producers to raise capital by issuing their own energy tokens. These
  tokens represent energy they commit to produce and deliver. Energy tokenization standardizes simplifies
  and opens globally currently existing energy investment ecosystem. As a result energy producers can
  trade directly with the green energy buyers (consumers and investors) and raise capital by selling energy
  upfront, at below market rates. Energy tokenization ensures liquidity and extends access to capital.
  The WePower blockchain solution is currently recognized by Elering, one of the most innovative Transmission
  System Operators in Europe.
