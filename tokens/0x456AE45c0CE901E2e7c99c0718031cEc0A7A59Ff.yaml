description: >-
  The Vision Network is a set of infrastructure for building a decentralized Internet. It is a distributed
  extensible virtual network, based on the physical network layer and the ISP network layer.


  Vision Network uses blockchain technology, distributed networks, and asymmetric encryption provides
  distributed services such as Proxy/VPN, multi-layer anonymous network, IM, DNS, even CDN, and DDoS defense,
  etc.


  The Voken â€“ Unique token in the Vision Network ecosystem with stable value scale will be used in the
  entire ecology and produce an incentive effect. Everyone can participate in distributed network construction.
  We believe the Vision Network will make the future Internet more open, more equal, more stable, more
  efficient, safer and freer.
