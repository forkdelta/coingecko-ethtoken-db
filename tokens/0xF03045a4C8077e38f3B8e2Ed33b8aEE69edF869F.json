Mesh technology is a telecommunications system that can work outside of regular cellular tower range due to the peer-to-peer mesh network it enables. By creating a network powered by Bluetooth - or WIFI, if available - the mesh network sidesteps typical cellular and data costs imposed by the incumbents.\n\nBlockMesh started in 2015 as a mesh network provider. A mesh network is a group of devices passing information from one to another until the recipient is reached. We are using this mesh network as a communications application, and as it can operate via Bluetooth and wifi instead of data, it is essentially cost-free once you\u2019re on the network. We\u2019re also using blockchain technology which enables us to reward users for supporting the network and brings our end-goal closer.","developer_score":18.747,"id":"blockmesh-2","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4093/large/blockmeshlogo.png?1547039268","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4093/small/blockmeshlogo.png?1547039268","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4093/thumb/blockmeshlogo.png?1547039268"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2535164,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xf03045a4c8077e38f3b8e2ed33b8aee69edf869f","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xf03045a4c8077e38f3b8e2ed33b8aee69edf869f"],"facebook_username":"Blockmesh","homepage":["https://www.blockmesh.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/servalproject/serval_chat"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockMesh_io/","twitter_screen_name":"blockmesh_io"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":2878,"name":"BlockMesh","public_interest_score":25.275,"symbol":"bmh","tickers":[{"base":"BMH","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"}]}
