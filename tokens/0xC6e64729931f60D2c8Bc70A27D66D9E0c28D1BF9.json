FLOW is designed to be a hedge against Bitcoin as today\u2019s primary digital store of value.\n\nThe protocol distributes inflation of FLOW tokens to all addresses holding it without the need for a single transaction. Inflation happens daily and does not require any action on the side of the FLOW token holder or any other parties. This method of inflation allows for the token to be applied to modern DeFi use cases without diluting the token holders.\n\nOver a period of 10 years, inflation is reduced and ends with a capped supply of FLOW tokens.\n\nFLOW does not need to be staked or locked into a contract to receive inflation, therefore it can be applied to the full range of DeFi applications while still achieving its distribution target.","developer_score":18.76,"id":"flow-protocol","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12147/large/FLOW_LOGO_BLACK_BG_200_200.png?1599722242","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12147/small/FLOW_LOGO_BLACK_BG_200_200.png?1599722242","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12147/thumb/FLOW_LOGO_BLACK_BG_200_200.png?1599722242"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@flowprotocol"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc6e64729931f60d2c8bc70a27d66d9e0c28d1bf9"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/NtYXK8x"],"homepage":["https://flowprotocol.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/flowprotocol/flow-contracts"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"flowprotocol","twitter_screen_name":"FlowProtocol"},"liquidity_score":21.617,"market_cap_rank":799,"name":"Flow Protocol","public_interest_score":0.003,"symbol":"flow","tickers":[]}
