  S.Genomics is an ecosystem that brings together several projects in the field of genomics and big computing.
  One of the important components of the project is a digital DNA storage or electronic Biobank.


  The name of the CTAGtoken token is an abbreviation of 4 types of nitrogenous bases that form DNA chains
  (Cytosine, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine). S.Genomics created CTAGtoken as a unit of a calculation inside
  an ecosystem.


  You can use CTAGtoken for purchase DNA tests and get your health passport; get a cell to store your
  genomic data in a Biobank; use to pay for the lease of the computing power of neural network for research
  purposes.
