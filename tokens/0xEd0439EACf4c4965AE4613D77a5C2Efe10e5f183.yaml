  Shroom.Finance is a fork of Sushiswap, an experimental protocol for DeFi chads building upon the most
  exciting innovations in programmable money.


  Shroom.Finance's goal is to grow a community of vested users which will build the next iteration of
  community-owned decentralised exchanges, with a particular focus on in-game assets. Any token will be
  tradeable from the Shroom platform, but we intend to specialise and the target will be the $10 billion
  in-game asset industry.


  We foresee a future where in-game assets, fungible and non-fungible, trade freely in a decentralised
  fashion, and we are here to take that spot and facilitate the ownership to a community of gamers.


  We invite the community to join and drive the governance of the platform.


  Please be advised that the $SHROOM token holds zero inherent value (similar to $YFI, $SUSHI, etc.),
  and itâ€™s intended as a governance token. Any value which may accrue to the token is entirely decided
  by the community and its token holders.


  The project is being built by top-notch engineers and designers with a successful past track record
  in crypto and the Ethereum ecosystem, but as always bugs might appear. Be sure you understand the Terms
  of Service before engaging with the protocol, which comes (as with the rest of other DeFi projects)
  with no guarantees.
