description: >-
  The Raiden Network is an off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments.
  It’s complementary to the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> blockchain
  and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research
  state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. The introduction of
  payment channels, specifically the type first described by the Lightning Whitepaper (which introduced
  the Lightning Network), seeks to fix the scalability and congestion issues that currently plague blockchain
  technology. While the Lightning Network operates on the Bitcoin blockchain, Raiden introduces a comparable
  solution for the Ethereum network.


  There are several key features of the Raiden Network Token. Expedited transfer confirmations (<1 second
  ). Current transfers on the Ethereum blockchain can take a few seconds to minutes. Private transfers
  that are not viewable on the global ledger. Solve scalability issues so that Ethereum can create mass
  adoption, allowing Ethereum to become the peer-to-peer, global payments infrastructure with electronic
  cash that it was initially designed for. Low fee transactions. Micropayment capability that works in
  union with any ERC-20 token.


  The Raiden Network project is being developed by Germany’s Brainbot Technologies AG, a software company
  devoted to blockchain protocol development. Founded in the year 2000 by Heiko Hees, it currently has
  between 11 to 50 employees in offices among Berlin, Mainz, and Copenhagen. Also the founder of PediaPress,
  Hees has been a core developer of Ethereum since March 2014. Being a core developer for Ethereum, it
  is evident on how the founder sees the flaws in the current its present protocol with ways to improve
  it. Interestingly enough, the website does not include RDN as one of their main blockchain developments,
  which could be attributed to the difficulty of highlighting a wide variety of projects they are currently
  undertaking on one page. However, there are no updates on the status of the Raiden Network Project on
  either Twitter nor Medium since December 1st, 2017.


  Raiden can be used for a wide variety of applications and purposes such as Micropayments For Content
  Distribution, Decentralized M2M Markets, API Access and Fast Decentralized Exchanges."
