description: >-
  Alchemy is a decentralized data model training platform based on chain security encryption operation
  and random forest training algorithm. Blockchain ecosystem nodes transfer transaction decision data
  back to beacons to realize data extraction, use, right determination and reward. At the same time, random
  forest algorithms are integrated to realize decentralized decision model construction and training system,
  and beacons feedback from data samples are used to modify the fitting model. As a result, a decentralized,
  self-iterative, autonomous incentive system data model training platform is realized.


  Alchemy smart contract records data related to transactions / transfers on the platform, and ensures
  that data ownership and use rights are independent of each other through multi-party secure encryption
  operations and sandbox data transaction. Alchemy Ecosystem does not store supplier data, but encapsulates
  the data into sandbox, using only the beacon fitting model fed back by data samples.


  The Alchemy ecological node can correct the model by transmitting the transaction decision data return
  beacon and get the corresponding Token reward; the node that mortgages a certain number of tokens can
  become the verification node, and the verification node can obtain the transaction data training set
  by the ecological node voting.


  Alchemy intelligent contract traces all the transaction records through machine learning, processes
  the data information, takes the maximum ACOIN as the goal, carries on the model construction and training
  iteration with the random forest algorithm, and obtains the transaction model based on the current training
  set.


  When the Alchemy model meets the requirements, the model can generate different trading pairs based
  on the algorithm and begin to trade automatically. At the same time, the model will be constantly optimized
  and adjusted.
