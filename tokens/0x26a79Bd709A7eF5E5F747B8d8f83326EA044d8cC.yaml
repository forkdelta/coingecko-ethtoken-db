description: >-
  BankSocial™ is a first-of-its-kind Decentralized Financed (“DeFi”) peer-to-peer lending platform built
  on Ethereum. Initially, members will be encouraged to hold $BSOCIAL crypto by redistribution of all
  token sales. Our vision is to build a proprietary BLOCKSCORE™ social credit scoring system and social
  consensus lending pool, built with the security of smart contracts, to provide asset backed lending
  to the world.
