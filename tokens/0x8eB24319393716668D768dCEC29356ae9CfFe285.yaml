  SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for Artificial Intelligence (AI). The business value of
  AI is becoming clearer each day; however, there’s a significant gap between the people developing AI
  tools (researchers and academics) and the businesses that want to use them. Most organizations need
  a more customized solution than what a single AI project can offer, and research projects oftentimes
  have trouble accessing a large enough data set to build effective machine learning. SingularityNET closes
  these gaps.


  The long-term vision of the SingulairtyNET team is to build a network of complex AI Agent interactions
  primarily using resources from the OpenCog Foundation. To look at this further, let’s check out their
  in-house built humanoid robot, Sophia. Sophia uses a combination of AI Agents that range from natural
  language processing to physical motor controls to operate. You tell Sophia to summarize a video that’s
  embedded in a webpage. To do this, Sophia sends a request to Agent A. Through its AI, Agent A knows
  that Agent B specializes in analyzing and transcribing video while Agent C specializes in summarizing
  text. Agent A pays Agent B and Agent C to perform these tasks while Sophia pays Agent A to coordinate.
  All the while, each Agent has updated their own AI with the network information gained from these tasks
  and combines it with their previous experiences and knowledge. Therefore, the collective AI of the system
  grows at a faster rate than any individual Agent.


  SingularityNET wants to build a decentralized protocol for creators and users of AI to interact with
  each other, to not only help individual projects benefit by leveraging the strengths of other AI systems
  that might handle certain tasks better, but ultimately to develop SingularityNET into a functioning
  AI system itself, with nodes on the network making their own decisions about how to connect services
  and proactively provide solutions to academic and business problems. Tokenizing the network creates
  an AI marketplace where AI developers and sellers can not only link with others who might assist in
  building more robust AI solutions, but also allow AI services and products to be bought and sold, creating
  revenue and establishing price points where none have existed before.


  The SingularityNET team boasts 50+ AI developers and 10+ PhDs. Dr. Ben Goertzel leads the group as CEO
  and Chief Scientist. He’s also the Chairman of the OpenCog Foundation and the Artificial General Intelligence
  Society, as well as the Chief Scientist at Hanson Robotics, the partner company helping bring SingularityNET
  to life. Dr. David Hanson, founder of Hanson Robotics, serves as the Robotics Lead. Most famously, Hanson
  Robotics built Sophia, the most expressive humanoid robot to date. Sophia is also a proud member of
  the SingularityNET team. The team recently released the alpha version of the platform and is planning
  on launching a public beta sometime in the middle of 2018.
