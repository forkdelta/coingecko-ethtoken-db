By investing in $STONK, you are investing in an index fund of DeFi's leading projects. Value in $STONK and value in the pool directly benefits all DeFi projects involved.\n\nThe deflationary nature of $STONK combined with the balancer pool creates a constant cycle of trading opportunities. This occurs while massive price movements such as swing trading & whale dumping are dampened - especially made prevalent by $STONK's 42% share in the pool.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"stonk","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11690/large/Iu1YBsl.png?1592798197","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11690/small/Iu1YBsl.png?1592798197","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11690/thumb/Iu1YBsl.png?1592798197"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/@stonkdev"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xb4058411967d5046f3510943103805be61f0600e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb4058411967d5046f3510943103805be61f0600e"],"chat_url":["https://discord.com/invite/EfHV4Nv"],"homepage":["https://stonk.dev/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/stonkdev/STONK"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"stonkdev","twitter_screen_name":"stonkdev"},"liquidity_score":25.048,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"STONK","public_interest_score":0.003,"symbol":"stonk","tickers":[]}
