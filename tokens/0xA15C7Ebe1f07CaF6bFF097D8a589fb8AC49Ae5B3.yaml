  Pundi X is the project that wants to make spending crypto as easy as a credit card. Creators of the
  NPXS token hope that it will one day be used on their <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>-based
  Point-of-Sale devices. This approach could give basic banking services to underdeveloped regions like
  Latin America and  Indonesia. One of the most notorious pain points in crypto is the ability to actually
  make purchases. Pundi X cryptocurrency plans to change all that by distributing hundreds to thousands
  of point-of-sale smart devices to retailers so they can accept payment in the form of NPXS, the network’s
  proprietary crypto token. If it can distribute the devices for free and with lower transaction fees
  than current card and mobile payment solutions provide, it’s a grand-slam idea.


  Pundi X raised $35 million during its ICO from September 2017 through January 21, 2018. 35,000,000,000
  NPXS (at the time known as PXS) were sold during the ICO presale and crowd sale. The team retained 15,750,000
  and another 1,750,000,000 was distributed to early investors and the rest was held by Pundi X for further
  development and marketing. It also set aside 2 percent of sold tokens to fund bounty programs across
  social media and online platforms.


  The Pundi X team are a talented group of technologists and entrepreneurs, which seems to be exactly
  what this project will need for success. In general the management team is comprised of computer engineers
  turned serial entrepreneur. The glaring exception to this is CEO and founder Zac Cheah, who was formerly
  an HTML games developer, but perhaps this is why he surrounded himself with such a strong team. The
  President of Pundi X, Constantin Papadimitrou, has a long history of founding successful fintech companies,
  and scaling them, which makes him an ideal fit for a project that will need rapid growth and adoption.
  The CTO/COO Pitt Huang created and sold his first business by the age of 25 and went on to create and
  sell several more business, including one that had over 200 employees.


  The company is working on developing a card, which they are naming the XPASS card, which will work together
  with the mobile app and wallet, enabling payments and deposits by card (a familiar medium for most)
  that are pulled from the mobile wallet. In addition, users should be able to see the current market
  price of each cryptocurrency before paying for goods and services, allowing them to pay with the cryptocurrency
  that brings the best value at the time. This ability to pay for things easily with cryptocurrencies
  is what will finally give them real value in a widespread sense.


  Pundi X has taken on an impressive and ambitious task in tackling what could amount to everyday adoption
  of cryptocurrencies by the masses, if their vision is realized. The technology seems appropriate for
  what they’re attempting, and the delivery of the first 500 POS devices shows that there is substance
  behind their efforts."
