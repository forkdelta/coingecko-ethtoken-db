description: >-
  OMS is an Ethereum based elastic supply token designed to rebase (inflate/deflate) supply through automated
  distribution proportional to percentage of supply held. Designed to be balanced against the USD, the
  issuance is always correlated to the USD denominated price at a given point in time.  OMS provides the
  base token for the ecosystem and will provide utility through being traded as a pair to assets in the
  OMS Asset Index.
