description: >-
  Content Neutrality Network (CNN) Platform introduces several mechanisms/protocols related to content
  creation, distribution, circulation and revenue share.  CNN Platform combines personalized recommendation
  with the community votes to distribute the most relevant content to each user. CCM (Content Circulation
  Mechanism) is designed to stimulate seamless circulation of content among different communities.


  CNN is an integral and indispensable part of the CNN Platform, because in the absence of CNN, there
  would be no common unit of exchange to pay for these costs or provide the incentive for certain desirable
  behavior, thus rendering the ecosystem on the CNN Platform unsustainable.
