description: >-
  Unicly is a permissionless, community-governed protocol to combine, fractionalize, and trade NFTs. Built
  by NFT collectors and DeFi enthusiasts, the protocol incentivizes NFT liquidity and provides a seamless
  trading experience for NFT assets.


  The UNIC token is going through a fair launch where tokens can only be minted through liquidity mining.
  The supply of UNIC will never reach 1 million, as inflation rate decreases each month. Token holders
  can govern the protocol by voting.
