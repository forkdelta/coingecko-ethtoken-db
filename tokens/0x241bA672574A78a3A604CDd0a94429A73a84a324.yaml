  4NEW Limited is a UK company that will own and operate Waste to Energy treatment plants. Given the severe
  shortfall of energy and surplus of waste, our product is grounded in necessities, solving two social
  problems. Our blockchain platform will be built on top of the underlying treatment infrastructure covering
  the entire supply chain from collection of waste to generation of electricity to sale of energy units
  to the national grid in the United Kingdom.
