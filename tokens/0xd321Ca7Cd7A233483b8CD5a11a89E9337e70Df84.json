Data is secured through zero-knowledge encryption, so only the user can access their content. Blockchain technology powers the company\u2019s internal VID Token, which is a digital currency used to transfer value across the network. Content creators can earn VID Tokens when other users view their videos. Brands and advertisers can also pay content creators directly with the VID Token, without Vid taking a cut.\n\nThe company has developed proprietary technology that leverages AI and machine learning techniques to automatically edit clips to the beat of the music, identify the most relevant parts of a clip, speed up and slow down content, and apply filters that give the final product a polished and professional feel. Vid holds two patents that protect its technology, with several others in review. The company is headquartered in Los Angeles, with satellite offices in South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Cayman Islands.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"vid","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10978/large/VI_Icon_%281%29.jpg?1594358218","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10978/small/VI_Icon_%281%29.jpg?1594358218","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/10978/thumb/VI_Icon_%281%29.jpg?1594358218"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/vid-foundation"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd321ca7cd7a233483b8cd5a11a89e9337e70df84","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd321ca7cd7a233483b8cd5a11a89e9337e70df84"],"chat_url":["https://www.instagram.com/vid_app/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/vidapplication/"],"homepage":["https://vid.camera/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"Vid_app","twitter_screen_name":"vid_app"},"liquidity_score":30.216,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Vid","public_interest_score":0.003,"symbol":"vi","tickers":[{"base":"0XD321CA7CD7A233483B8CD5A11A89E9337E70DF84","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap (v2)"},"target":"ETH"}]}
