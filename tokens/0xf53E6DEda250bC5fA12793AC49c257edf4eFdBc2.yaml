  Squeezer brings the microservices technology to blockchain technology. This move fixes the scaling issues
  and adjusts the stack to fit within the blockchain flexibility. Squeezer are building so called connectors
  which make the blockchain more friendly to developers and provide instant access to the blockchains
  data assets.


  Main features of Squeezer

  Squeezer is a platform that helps software developers build apps easily without tackling the entire
  blockchain infrastructure. It is also a powerful tool for providing high-quality blockchain software
  components to large enterprise organizations. Squeezer uses world-class microservices platforms, such
  as AWS Lambda, Google Functions, and Azure Functions.


  Squeezer Token

  The Squeezer Platform is powered by the SQR token. Developers will purchase platform subscriptions with
  the token to create their applications. Additionally, all consultancy services provided by the Squeezer
  team will be paid for in SQR tokens.

  Every 6 months, we will use 25% of our profits to buy back SQR and destroy them, until we buy 40% of
  all the SQR back.
