  The overall function of GIVE is that a portion of the trading fees will be withdrawn weekly via a governance
  vote and donated to the Charity that the community chooses.


  GIVE is arranged in a way that we not only perpetuate the crypto currency of the future, but we are
  constantly giving back with direct donations from the GIVE community.
