  Balancer is a non-custodial portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor


  The Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL) are distributed to Liquidity Providers of Balancer. BALs
  are a key way of decentralizing the governance of the protocol such that it can remain resilient over
  time, protected from the failure of any single stakeholder.


  The proposed amount of distributed BALs to liquidity providers is 145,000 per week, or approximately
  7.5M per year. This means in the first year of BALâ€™s existence there would be 30% supply inflation off
  the initially allocated supply of 25M tokens. This high rate of supply inflation is meant to kickstart
  the distribution of governance rights of the protocol out to those who earn it.
