  We want to become the Alibaba of Wealth Management, PHI means Platform for Hybrid Investments but also
  Hybrid Platform for Investing. We want to create a clear separation between the production of financial
  instruments and the distribution to the clients, combining both traditional financial instrument and
  crypto related products in the first platform of social investment.

  The differences between a Social Trading Platform and a Social Investment Platform are principally:
  (i) not short term speculator as clients but long term investors; (ii) not traders but professional
  Asset Managers for the management of the portfolio of the clients; (iii) a perfectly regulated Management
  Account platform authorized by MFSA.
