  The financial system orchestrator for mobility services

  The lack of systemic direction is a key reason that the influx of different mobility modes into cities
  has increased the complexity but not the overall performance of todayâ€™s urban transport.


  MobiFi is the financial orchestrator for Mobility as a Service (MaaS). It provides a transparent platform
  with a tokenized payment system to connect mobility service providers and travellers. Its unique DeFi
  bridge revives your mobility credit and turns it into a yield engine.
