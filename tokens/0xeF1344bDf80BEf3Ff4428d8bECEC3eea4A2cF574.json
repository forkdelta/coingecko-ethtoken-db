Further these rewards can be redeemed back by the users within the ecosystem. Era Swap Ecosystem includes multiple interlinked platforms as below:\n\uf0d8\tTimeAlly DApp \u2013 Set of smart contract driven token vesting platform which rewards the community for vesting.

There have been multiple platforms for buyers and sellers across the globe however there are few elementary problems with traditional centralized platforms:\n\n\u2022\tLack affordable learning platforms exclusively for high end technologies\n\u2022\tLack of Self paced learning applications where millineal from remote area can learn technology, anytime anywhere through mobile or web\n\u2022\tLack of awareness among coming generation about the dynamic nature of technology and its insurgence in daily life\n\u2022\tLack of aggregators model which connects teachers/subject matter expert with knowledge seeker/ students worldwide without any barrier\n\u2022\tLack of social platforms which rewards users as well as their circle for their contribution in peer to peer mode for exchange of services\n\u2022\tFreelance platforms charge about 10-30% fees per transaction as middlemen.\n\u2022\tGlobal payment gateways charge between 30% to 40% for processing payment transaction\n\u2022\tTraditional Banking charges are between 2- 3% \n\u2022 For doing the transaction, need several trusted parties and there is a cost to each trusted party.\n\u2022 Users have no control over their data which can be further misused by these middlemen.\n\u2022 No profit is shared with the users by these existing traditional platforms.\nSolution approach\nThe team is working on the solution to solve this problem for buyers & sellers.

Here users communicate in transparent P2P mode to exchange their requirements on day to day basis. Team is focused on simplifying the offerings with user friendly solutions which can be used easily by any common man and doesn\u2019t requires much tech savvy knowledge to operate.\nApart from this we have a team of 30 plus software developers day in & day out working to make better solutions for community\"","developer_score":0.0,"id":"era-swap-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6031/large/era_swap.PNG?1570920926","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6031/small/era_swap.PNG?1570920926","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6031/thumb/era_swap.PNG?1570920926"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://eraswap.tumblr.com/","https://medium.com/@eraswap"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5025979,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xef1344bdf80bef3ff4428d8becec3eea4a2cf574"],"chat_url":["https://mix.com/eraswap","https://www.instagram.com/eraswap/","https://www.linkedin.com/company/eraswap/"],"facebook_username":"eraswap","homepage":["https://eraswaptoken.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/KMPARDS/EraSwapSmartContracts","https://github.com/KMPARDS/Eraswap_life"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"eraswap","twitter_screen_name":"eraswaptec"},"liquidity_score":26.082,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Era Swap Token","public_interest_score":0.005,"symbol":"es","tickers":[{"base":"ES","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"ProBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"ES","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"ProBit"},"target":"USDT"}]}
