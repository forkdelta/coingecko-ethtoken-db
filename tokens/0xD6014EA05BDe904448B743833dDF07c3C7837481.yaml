  Inverse BTC by Synthetix


  Inversely tracks the price of Bitcoin through price feeds supplied by an oracle. Its value freezes when
  it reaches its upper limit of $12600 (i.e. when Bitcoin’s value reaches $4200) or its lower limit of
  $4200 (i.e. when Bitcoin’s value reaches $12600). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen,
  it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths
  at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted
  for another iBTC with different limits.
