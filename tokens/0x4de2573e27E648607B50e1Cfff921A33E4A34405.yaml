description: >-
  Lendroid is a 0x-inspired, non-rent seeking, trust-independent, open protocol enabling decentralized
  lending, margin trading and short selling on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to solve the shortcomings
  of centralized exchanges by creating a global shared lending pool, and a symbiotic off-chain infrastructure
  supported by incentivized participants - Relayers and Wranglers. Simply put, Lenders contribute their
  offers to the lending pool through relayers, who then match the offers with appropriate traders. The
  traders can use the borrowed funds to margin trade, make a profit, and repay the lenders.
