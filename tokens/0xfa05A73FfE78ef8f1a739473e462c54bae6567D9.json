It strives to be the most innovative and comprehensive source of knowledge in domains like crypto projects, technology, finance, law, investment, and more, on the web.\n\nThe cofounders of Lunyr are Arnold Pham, Andrew Tran, and Christopher Smith. The Lunyr ICO ended on 26th April 2017, with around USD 0.3 million in capital being generated. The open beta was then launched on 30th January 2018. It is based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> network. The reward system which enables writers to earn rewards for authoring articles was also launched at the same time, allowing writers to earn LUN coins in exchange for quality pieces. Initially, Lunyr will mostly focus on the world of cryptocurrencies and related domains, with emphasis on up and coming projects. After an active and dedicated community of readers and writers is developed, Lunyr will branch into other areas such as science and technology, investment, finance, etc.\n\nLunyr is unique in its vision, and usage of the blockchain technology in order to provide a comprehensive, decentralised, crowdsource, and peer-reviewed vault of knowledge, open and free to everyone. Lunyr aims to not only be a knowledge encyclopedia for the web, but also intends to enhance the blockchain technology by giving DApps (Decentralised Applications) the ability to tap into the knowledge base and access real-time data. This innovative feature can be used in applications ranging from Virtual Reality to Artificial Intelligence. The decentralised and peer-to-peer nature of Lunyr allows all content on the knowledge-base to be free from manipulation, and censorship. Since all submissions are peer-reviewed by the community, the chances of incorrect or dubious data making its way onto the encyclopedia are very low.","developer_score":38.628,"id":"lunyr","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/735/large/lunyr.png?1547976492","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/735/small/lunyr.png?1547976492","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/735/thumb/lunyr.png?1547976492"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1818468,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0xfa05a73ffe78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567d9","https://etherscan.io/token/0xfa05A73FfE78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567D9","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xfa05a73ffe78ef8f1a739473e462c54bae6567d9"],"homepage":["https://lunyr.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Lunyr/crowdsale-contracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Lunyr","twitter_screen_name":"Lunyrinc"},"liquidity_score":23.311,"market_cap_rank":470,"name":"Lunyr","public_interest_score":25.543,"symbol":"lun","tickers":[{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"bamboo_relay","name":"Bamboo Relay"},"target":"WETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"binance","name":"Binance"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"coineal","name":"Coineal"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"forkdelta","name":"ForkDelta"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"LUN","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"DOGE"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"RUR"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"LUNYR","market":{"identifier":"yobit","name":"YoBit"},"target":"WAVES"}]}
