Data consumers can use a variety of services (statistics, surveys, advertising, etc.) within the health care system without having to download data and deliver results.And the data that is licensed to be utilized can be accessed and utilized again within the authorized time frame at any time.\n\nAs such, the proceeds from data consumption are fairly distributed to the data production, delivery, retention, and administrator, enabling data sovereignty to be realized in real life.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"healthchainus","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11868/large/60633927_588600498303961_3291974703035449344_n.png?1595496238","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11868/small/60633927_588600498303961_3291974703035449344_n.png?1595496238","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/11868/thumb/60633927_588600498303961_3291974703035449344_n.png?1595496238"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/healthchainus"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xd31a9d28d66a1f7e62b5565416ea14607690f788","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xd31a9d28d66a1f7e62b5565416ea14607690f788"],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/gT9uazrb"],"facebook_username":"Healthchainus","homepage":["https://healthchainus.com/"]},"liquidity_score":13.017,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"HealthChainUS","public_interest_score":0.993,"symbol":"hcut","tickers":[]}
