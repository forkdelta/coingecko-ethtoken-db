  Tokenized YES shares in Augur's 2020 U.S. presidential election market.

  At any point in time, the token price signals the market's perceived probability of Trump winning the
  election. For example, if the token is trading at .46 DAI, that signals roughly 46% odds of victory.

  If Trump wins the election, each share is redeemable for one DAI and if he loses, for zero DAI.
