description: >-
  USDx is a decentralized and synthetic indexed stablecoin introduced by dForce as the first and cornerstone
  protocol. It is 1:1 pegged to a basket of constituent stablecoins, integrated with interest bearing
  capability. USDx's initial underlying portfolios include USDC, TUSD, PAX and DAI (1 USDx = 30% USDC,
  30 %TUSD, 30% PAX and 10% DAI), which can be adjusted by on-chain governance. The synthetization and
  disaggregation of USDx is wholly on-chain to ensure maximized transparency, immutability and auditability.

  DF is the platform utility token of the dForce network to be used for transaction services, community
  governance, system stabilizer, incentivization, validator deposit when we migrate to staking model,
  and etc.
