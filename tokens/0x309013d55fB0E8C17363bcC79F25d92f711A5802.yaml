description: >-
  Inspired by MakerDao, Compound, Synthetix and Ampleforth, this project aims to

  peg an ERC20 token (sBTC) price to 0.0001 BTC or 100,000 Satoshi by utilizing the

  built-in smart contract token contraction & expansion algorithm, variable staking

  policies and sBTC Foundation reserves to ensure that one sBTC will be

  mathematically guaranteed to be worth 0.0001 BTC in the short/medium term

  regardless of circumstances.
