  Bill Williams Alligator & Fractals


  All trading decisions for this set will be made using the daily price chart on BraveNewCoin's ELX index.


  The 'Alligator' consists of the 13, 8, and 5 period moving averages (MA) and is used to determine the
  status of the trend - bullish, bearish, or ranging.


  Entries and stop losses are determined based on the position of price relative to the bullish or bearish
  fractals.


  - A bull fractal consists of a low-high-low candle pattern

  - A bear fractal consists of a high-low-high candle pattern


  - A bull trend should not break bear fractals

  - A bear trend should not break bull fractals


  If price breaches above a bullish fractal during a bullish trend, the signal dictates adding to the
  trading position.


  If price breaches below a bearish fractal during a bullish trend, the signal dictates a stop loss trigger.


  These entry or exit triggers occur after a candle close for the period. The candle body must close above
  or below the fractal of the prior period to satisfy the trade trigger condition.
