  What is PolkaRare?

  PolkaRare is a web3 economy to create, trade, and discover NFTs. Powered by Polkadot, Polygon, Ethereum,
  and Binance Smart Chain, PolkaRare offers artists a seamless onboarding experience without the need
  to use Metamask or make contract transactions on their own. PolkaRare provides a range of tools to users
  to unlock the maximum potential of NFTs. $PRARE is the native token of PolkaRare used for governance,
  staking rewards, medium of exchange, NFT farming, etc.


  Who is the Founder of PolkaRare?

  PolkaRare is founded by Pramod Mahadik, a professional software developer. Pramod has over eight years
  of experience in building projects and has previously served at Rediff and Halalbox. Pramod has over
  four years of experience in the Blockchain space. He is a successful influencer and venture capitalist
  who has been advising multiple portfolio projects for development and team building.


  What is The USP of PolkaRare?

  PolkaRare offers NFT creation, NFT trading, multi-token support, community rewards, support licensed
  content drops, price discoverability, and charges low network fees. Currently, most of the NFT platforms
  are based on Ethereum. However, the high traffic of the Ethereum network creates various issues in creating
  and trading NFTs. PolkaRare aims to become a multi-chain NFT platform, where creators and users can
  optimize the blockchains and seamlessly transfer them across different networks. PolkaRare NFT creation
  will start on Ethereum and Polygon chains. In the next phase, the NFT will be added to the BSC and will
  be extended to other blockchain networks gradually.
