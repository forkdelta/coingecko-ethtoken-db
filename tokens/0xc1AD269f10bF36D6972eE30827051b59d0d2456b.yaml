description: >-
  AGOV is an investment platform that allows anyone to easily invest and trade by tokenizing real food
  assets based on blockchain with DeFi tokens mined through AGOV Finance. Food asset markets such as wine
  and whiskey can reliably generate high returns, but due to the structure of the market, private participation
  was almost impossible as investments were only possible with large funds. ANSWER Governance platform
  tokenizes these assets on a blockchain basis, providing individuals with opportunities to participate
  and trade in food material investments. Assets are transparently managed based on tokens, and now any
  participant of the ANSWER Governance platform can earn high returns by investing in small amounts in
  tokenized assets. In addition, AGOV is an official partner of Klaytn, and can supply liquidity in the
  AGOV-KLAY and AGOV-HINT pairs on Klay Swap, and through AGOV Finance, you can mine ERC-20 and then swap
  to Klaytn.
