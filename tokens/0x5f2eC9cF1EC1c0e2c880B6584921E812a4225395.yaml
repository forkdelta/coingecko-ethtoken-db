  Unicorn's benefit lies in the fact that everyone can:

  - Sharing news

  - Asking questions or give advice on Cryptos

  - Contributing to elarge the democratization of 2.0 currencies

  Launched in Beta on December 15, 2017, the project has currently gathered more

  than 4,000 participants from around the globe. Members of the Bitcoin Unicorn

  community will all receive an equal portion of a token after registration.

  From there, the opportunity to earn more tokens by participating in the

  community will allow Bitcoin Unicorn to grow and improve. It's not possible to

  invest large sums into a community with no guaranteed return
