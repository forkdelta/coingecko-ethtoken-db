  MorCrypto is the crypto halve of Africa with trading exchange, mining service, cryptocurrency e-commerce,
  and multiple cryptocurrency investment opportunities.


  MorCrypto Exchange


  MorCrypto Exchange is the p2p trading sector of MorCrypto were users can trade various crypto currencies
  within them selfs. We say MorCrypto is the crypto halve of Africa because once we have obtained full
  license to operate as a trading exchange in Nigeria and with Nigeria being the leading nation in the
  blockchain among other African countries it will give us the leverage to openly approach as many Africa
  Nations that do not restrict the use of crypto currencies and introduce them all into crypto currency,
  when these happens our database will increase massively and the use of our base coin MOR will increase
  tremendously and that will lead to a drastic escalation of the price of our base coin MOR, Nigeria has
  a total of over 200 million population and a recent report shows that in Africa, 1 in 5 is Nigerian.


  The Central Bank of Nigeria is currently undergoing tutorials on crypto assets, meaning they are interested
  in the blockchain and cryptocurrency and being the only body that can restrict crypto trading in Nigeria,
  it is good news that they are showing interest towards having a better understanding of cryptocurrencies.
  We strongly believe the blockchain will have so much impact on the African continent in the nearest
  future, in the energy sector where billions of dollars has been spent without results, also in the financial
  sector to bring more transparency which bank customers crave for.


  We want to be at the forefront of every innovation in the African blockchain industry, spearheading
  and introducing products for the governments of the entire continent. And because we will also have
  other Asian and European project listing their Tokens on our Exchange, the community on our Exchange
  will be one of the largest in the world. MorCrypto Exchange is has a base coin MOR
