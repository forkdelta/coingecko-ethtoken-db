description: >-
  The ITO Utility Token [IUT] is a vital component of the ITO Protocol crowdfunding model, giving participants
  instant liquidity on all tokenised pledges from ITOs. This fundamental element allows the ITO Protocol
  to offer zero-risk participation when supporting initiative crowdfunding opportunities in comparison
  to other forms of high-risk crowdfunding/investment such as IEOs or ICOs, which often leave participants
  with illiquid of unlisted tokens for a sometimes indefinite period of time.
