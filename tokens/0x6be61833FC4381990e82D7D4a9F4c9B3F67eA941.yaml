  ecology system for digital currency exchange.


  Project characteristic


  1.Exoteric market making pool (To lower the risk at the beginning of the operation, it’s only accessible
  to the project party and temporarily devised to be open to all clients in the second quarter of 2018).The
  project party and the community will inject assets together to create high liquidity of the market making
  fund, create good market depth and width for traders, and help to stabilize the price of the trading
  assets. The primary goal of the market making pool is to increase the liquidity and the secondary aim
  is to maintain the stability of the capital and keep balance of the position. The algorithm of the market
  marking pool is developed by the prime quantitative trading team on Wall Street and directly inserted
  to the exchange system, accessible to the project party and the community free of charge.


  2.The community automatic token-listing system( during the initial period, only ERC20 tokens are supported
  and later will extend to other type of blockchains. It will depend on the ICO party or the community
  to provide fundamental information. The exchange will carry out fast verification, after which the market
  making pool will begin to accept capital inejection. When the capital injection meets the minimal requirements
  of market making fund, the asset will automatically get listed.


  3.The digital assets wiki system (the second quarter of 2018) will use the community’s strength to supplement
  various information of the trading assets and find out the projects which have potential frauds, the
  contributors will be rewarded with HTB.


  4.Core team & Service system supported by the community. With the explosion of users, traditional customer
  service department is difficult to develop sustainably under the burden of a million-scale customers.
  Hotbit will design a worldwide customer service system participated by the community and the service

  and third quarter of 2018) and absorb professional agencies to design and issue option, contracts, ETF
  and many other derivatives. Both designing and trading derivatives will need to hold and consume a certain
  amount of HTB.
