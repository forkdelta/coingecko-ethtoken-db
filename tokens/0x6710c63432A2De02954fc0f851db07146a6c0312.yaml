  Smart MFG (MFG) is an ERC20 cryptocurrency token issued by Smart MFG Tech for use in supply chain and
  manufacturing smart contracts. MFG can be used to incentivize RFQs, secure and pay for smart contract
  POs (Purchase Orders) along with supply chain tokenization on the manufacturing blockchain.


  Smart MFG claims to be 'the pioneer and creator of the smart manufacturing blockchain process architecture
  protocol' (patent pending). SyncFab is also a digital manufacturing platform that enables hardware supply
  chain buyers to transact POs (purchase orders) and source RFQs (requests for quotes) directly from a
  network of manufacturers (launched in 2013).
