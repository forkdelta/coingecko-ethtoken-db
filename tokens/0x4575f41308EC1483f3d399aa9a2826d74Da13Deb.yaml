description: >-
  The Orchid Protocol organizes bandwidth sellers into a structured peer-to-peer (P2P) network termed
  the Orchid Market. Customers connect to the Orchid Market and pay bandwidth sellers in order to form
  a proxy chain to a specific resource on the Internet.


  Unlike more common methods for sending and receiving data from the global Internet, proxy chains in
  the Orchid Market naturally separate information about the source of data from information about its
  destination; no single relay or proxy holds both pieces of information, or knows the identity of someone
  who does. The structure of the Orchid Market further supports this separation of information by providing
  strong resistance against collusion attacks â€“ the ability of a group of bandwidth sellers to overcome
  this separation of knowledge.


  The Internet was originally an open platform where people could freely learn and communicate. Unfortunately,
  as the Internet grew it became a place where people could be monitored, controlled, and censored. We're
  building a new civil contract around a distributed marketplace for computation, storage, and bandwidth
  to provide the framework for a new form of digital citizenship.
