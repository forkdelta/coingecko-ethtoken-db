description: >-
  This algorithmic strategy combines proprietary logic taken from multiple timeframes focused on ETH versus
  USDC to either decide to hold ETH or USDC for the next 12 hours.

  In general it averages around 15 trades (like "buy ETH" or "buy USDC") per month. So it does trade a
  lot.

  For the January 1, 2020 - May 19, 2020 timeframe its backtested lowest drawdown was about -20% and its
  backtested returns are currently up +183% (ETH itself is up +67%).
