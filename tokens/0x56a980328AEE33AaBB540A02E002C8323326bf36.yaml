description: >-
  POODL is an ERC-20 deflationary token. In particular, 1% of every transaction is automatically burned
  and another 1% is redistributed to holders. This increases scarcity of the supply of POODL tokens, which
  means that every POODL holder has a strong incentive to hold tokens and spread the use of POODL.
