  Saren (SAR) (https://saren.io/) is the governance token for Cerberus, a decentralized cryptocurrency
  tracking application (https://cerberus.saren.io/).


  The Cerberus app is now live, enabling users to view their wallet contents, and track their favourite
  projects in a variety of ways; including price, social media and online search activity, developer activity
  and many more.


  SAR holders are entitled to cast votes on which tokens may be listed on Cerberus, giving them a unique
  opportunity to influence the crypto space, and promote their favourite tokens.


  SAR holders will further benefit from the upcoming development of Cerberus, which will introduce aspects
  similar to Reddit, such as user determined project ranking, and community discussion forums.
