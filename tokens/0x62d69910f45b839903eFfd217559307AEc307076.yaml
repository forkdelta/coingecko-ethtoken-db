description: >-
  AfterShock is a deflationary staking token with no technical knowledge needed for staking. Holding coins
  in an ERC-20 wallet is all that is required to participate in staking.


  With each Wallet to Wallet SHOCK transaction 3% of the transferred amount will be destroyed forever,
  and another 3% will be rewarded to all SHOCK holders (Circulating Supply). Each holder will receive
  a reward proportionate to the SHOCK held in their wallet.
