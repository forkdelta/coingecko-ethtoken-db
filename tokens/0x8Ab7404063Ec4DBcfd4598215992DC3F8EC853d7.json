All funds are pooled, and the internal economy is based on a bonding curve, which provides additional incentives to the users.\n\nOur second product is Delphi, a yield farming aggregator with dollar cost averaging tooling. Delphi allows users to gain yield on synthetic savings, farm tokens from integrated protocols/pools, and invest in volatile assets using an active \u201call in\u201d approach or a passive dollar cost averaging strategy.","developer_score":45.629,"id":"akropolis","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3328/large/Akropolis.png?1547037929","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3328/small/Akropolis.png?1547037929","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3328/thumb/Akropolis.png?1547037929"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/akropolis"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":3416631,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x8ab7404063ec4dbcfd4598215992dc3f8ec853d7","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x8ab7404063ec4dbcfd4598215992dc3f8ec853d7"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/AkropolisAnnouncements"],"homepage":["http://sparta.akropolis.io/","https://akropolis.io"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolis-discovery","https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolis-network","https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolis-polkadot","https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolisOS"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"akropolis_official","twitter_screen_name":"akropolisio"},"liquidity_score":52.578,"market_cap_rank":189,"name":"Akropolis","public_interest_score":0.012,"symbol":"akro","tickers":[{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"eterbase","name":"Eterbase"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"gate","name":"Gate.io"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"huobi_id","name":"Huobi Indonesia"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"huobi_korea","name":"Huobi Korea"},"target":"HT"},{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"AKRO","market":{"identifier":"uniswap_v1","name":"Uniswap (v1)"},"target":"ETH"}]}
