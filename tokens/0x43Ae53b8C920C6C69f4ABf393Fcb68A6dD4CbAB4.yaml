  "The RiveMont is a new DEX protocol. Controversially to Uniswap, RiveMont provides liquidity providers
  with forever passive income.

  For example, on Uniswap, a liquidity provider stops earning a fee’s share after withdrawing funds from
  a pool. A RiveMont’s liquidity provider, on the other hand, gets a fee share even after removing funds
  from a pool. The utility value of RVMT contains liquidity provisioning, governing the creation of new
  markets, fee and spread sizes, borrowing APRs, and more. Although the RVMT total supply unlimited, the
  part of the market-making fee used to buyback and burn RVMT."
