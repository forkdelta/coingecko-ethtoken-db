  Synthetic Inverse Dash

  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse Dash (DASH) through price feeds supplied by an oracle. The entry
  point is $64.44 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when it reaches
  its upper limit of $96.66 (i.e. when Inverse Dash's value reaches $32.22) or its lower limit of $32.22
  (i.e. when Inverse Dashâ€™s value reaches $96.66). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen,
  it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths
  at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted
  for another iDASH with different limits.
