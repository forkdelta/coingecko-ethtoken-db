  Friendz is a digital marketing company whose main goal is to connect brands with their target audience,
  taking advantage of the most powerful marketing tool ever: “word of mouth”. When we look at what the
  future holds for us we see global expansion, larger communities of users, more services provided and
  happier clients. All this made possible by the use of the blockchain technology and the adoption of
  Friendz Coins, the new standard currency for buying digital services and activate community of engaged
  users all around the world.


  Friendz has been actively present in the market since 2016. As of year 2018, we have offered services
  to more than 200 brands. Our team is composed of 35 people, with different backgrounds and skills, operating
  in our offices in Switzerland, Italy and Spain. Friendz app boasts over 200,000 organic users who have
  published well over 3,000,000 pictures in the last two years. In 2016 Friendz received €500,000 worth
  of financing from Triboo Group, a public company and important player in the digital marketing industry,
  enabling it to hit the market and create its network. At the end of 2017 revenues amounted to € 1,200,000.


  Roadmap

  1. We plan to use blockchain technology to provide an even safer and reliable experience to our clients.

  Through the use of a decentralized blockchain technology that the safe transfer of funds and the completion
  of services will be certified. Friendz platform will become even safer and more advanced technologically
  thereby protecting the interest of our community and clients worldwide.


  2. We plan to decentralize the digital advertising business, creating a traceable single tool that can
  be adopted globally to activate users and involve them in the creation of advertising campaigns.

  We are planning to introduce a transparent system that will track the flow of marketing spending on
  Friendz platform, in a totally revolutional way to digital advertising. The use of Friendz Coins will
  in fact provide brands with the opportunity to spread their advertising messages and to reach the friends
  of Friendz users in a genuine and creative way. Users will be rewarded for being active and will use
  the reward to purchase other services from Friendz.


  3. In the long term we want to provide every online activity-as-a-service, in and beyond the world of
  digital marketing. The idea is to develop a platform where companies can activate large communities
  of users to perform various activities that will enhance their brands.

  Our plan is to maintain a focus on digital advertising but with an open eye on new markets and opportunities.
  Friendz platform will be available to any company that requires services such as validation systems,
  quick content generation, bug testing, market research and app review. Our clients will not only be
  B2C companies, but also B2B, and those coming from the blockchain industry, all with the common goal
  of reaching the final users. The automation of all activities will ensure that Friendz’s role becomes
  that of merely guaranteeing community participation and engagement in the activities proposed.
