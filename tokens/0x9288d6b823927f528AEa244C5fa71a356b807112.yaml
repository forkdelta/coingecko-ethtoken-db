  Japan Content Token Project, JCT Project, realizes a platform which allows visitors, especially from
  overseas, to search and to experience various Japan “contents” by using the blockchain technology. There
  exists virtually no project with this kind of objectives regardless of whether based on the blockchain
  technology or not. JCT will create a platform for generating totally new values. This platform will,
  then, provide to its participants with clear benefits by leveraging three factors of the blockchain
  technology, to be described later. Besides, from the onset, the JCT project will involve experienced
  business entities as group companies to leverage the platform and also plans specific affiliations,
  which will be released soon. Moreover, this platform includes a mechanism to minimize the excessive
  liquidity of tokens in exchange markets by assuring the siphoning-off of tokens from the market in accordance
  with platform usage. Furthermore, the initial token to be issued will be approximately 30 million, and
  the token volume will be gradually increased up to 180 million over a course of a decade, by monitoring
  the platform growth. This project is led by a management team of entrepreneurs with listing experience
  of multiple corporations, with the depth of business-development experience, and leading art directors
  of Japan. This management team is supported by powerful partners, Cybex, one of the most influential
  advocates of the Blockchain industry born in China, and Monstar Lab, Inc., which holds multiple global
  R&D centers. This the JCT project is the first project in Japan, backed by actual businesses, a strong
  development system, and a management team with deep experiences.
