Voting reflects the Reputation activity of each participant and each different Voting will have a different Voting share. Voting of the coin is determined by a large number of people, which prevents valueless coins from being traded at a high price and valuable coins from being traded for low prices and being unrecognizable in the market.\n\nMoreover, it means that if the Voting Power increases, the Token Expert also increases leading to Voting participants to hope and grow to be a Token Expert.\n\nIn comparison, Token Experts will provide more precise and objective information than general Voting users, and the accumulation of these data will be an indicator of a window of information delivery and investment.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"apot","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6449/large/apot.png?1547042642","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6449/small/apot.png?1547042642","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/6449/thumb/apot.png?1547042642"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5059749,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x16c1e5baf21b9fa4bc9f2c374e4dc19fab5ac5dc","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x16c1e5baf21b9fa4bc9f2c374e4dc19fab5ac5dc"],"chat_url":["https://open.kakao.com/o/g3m71BZ"],"facebook_username":"AllbitOfficial","homepage":["https://apot.io/"],"twitter_screen_name":"allbitofficial"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"APOT","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"apot","tickers":[{"base":"APOT","market":{"identifier":"probit","name":"ProBit"},"target":"KRW"}]}
