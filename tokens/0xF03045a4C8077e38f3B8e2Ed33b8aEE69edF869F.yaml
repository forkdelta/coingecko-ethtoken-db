description: >-
  BlockMesh, a software company based in Mauritius - utilizes the latest innovations in mesh networking
  technology to create cost-free communication networks and aim to disrupt the global communications industry
  in 2018. Mesh technology is a telecommunications system that can work outside of regular cellular tower
  range due to the peer-to-peer mesh network it enables. By creating a network powered by Bluetooth -
  or WIFI, if available - the mesh network sidesteps typical cellular and data costs imposed by the incumbents.


  BlockMesh started in 2015 as a mesh network provider. A mesh network is a group of devices passing information
  from one to another until the recipient is reached. We are using this mesh network as a communications
  application, and as it can operate via Bluetooth and wifi instead of data, it is essentially cost-free
  once you’re on the network. We’re also using blockchain technology which enables us to reward users
  for supporting the network and brings our end-goal closer.
