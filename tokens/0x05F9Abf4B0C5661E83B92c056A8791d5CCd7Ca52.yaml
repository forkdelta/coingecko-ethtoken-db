description: >-
  Joos Protocol is the world’s fastest and most effective debt collection solution built on transparency
  and cost-efficiency. This autonomous and automated solution based on a decentralized and immutable public
  ledger system enables users to monitor their entire debt collection solution across a global audience
  of incentivised digital debt collectors to expedite and optimise successful account remedy solutions.
  Simple – Using an immutable distributed ledger and with the help of “validators” your debtors list is
  verified and data integrity is maintained. At the event of default – 1st and 2nd follow-ups are automated
  mail outs and SMS. Third response sets off the social debt collection response. Details of the debt
  and a bounty are sent out to the network. “collectors” then work using digital and social pressure to
  remedy account discrepancies.
