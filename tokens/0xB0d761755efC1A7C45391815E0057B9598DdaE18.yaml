description: >-
  More than just an exchange, a two-way peg permits transfer of both assets and data across consensus-independent
  blockchains. One can use Dogethereum to roll DOGE off of Dogecoin onto Ethereum and back via a trustless,
  retrofitting bridge, or, in a similar spirit, spill ERC-20 tokens off of Ethereum into the broader ecosystem


  Inspired by Jason Teutsch, our team continues to explore compatibility and interactivity between Dogcoin
  and Ethereum
