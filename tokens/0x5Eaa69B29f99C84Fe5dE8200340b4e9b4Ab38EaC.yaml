description: >-
  Raze Network is a Substrate-based cross-chain privacy protocol for the Polkadot ecosystem. It is building
  a Cross-chain Privacy Middleware for DeFi and Web3.0. It is a native privacy layer that can provide
  end-to-end anonymity for the entire DeFi and Web3.0 stack.


  The objective is to enable cross-chain privacy-preserving payment and trading systems, while protecting
  the transparency of your assets and behaviors from surveillance. Eventually, Raze Network can anonymize
  all the cryptocurrency across all chains.
