  Melalie is a peer-to-peer (P2P) mobility marketplace. On the Melalie platform, people can rent vehicles
  from each other, without the need for intermediaries. The Melalie platform is complete, tested, live
  and already lists over 400 local vendors. The application can be downloaded in the Appstore (iOS) and
  the Google Playstore (Android


  The mobility market is a multi billion dollar market, that is dominated by massive centralized companies.
  Our mission is to provide a decentralized alternative and bring crypto benefits to this huge market.
  This is why the Melalie platform is powered by the $MEL token. In April, Melalie will launch its first
  token sale. The $MEL token is a revenue share token that not only provides a return for investors, but
  will also be used for payments and for managing the DAO behind the platform.
