  What is BnkToTheFuture.com?

  We started our mission in 2010 to build the largest and most reputable Online Investment Platform to
  allow our qualifying investors to co-invest in the future of finance and technology - globally.


  What is the BF Token (BFT)?

  The BF Token (BFT) can be used by all as a reward and membership token to help us create

  - A less centralised process for listing on BnkToTheFuture.com.

  - A community enhanced due diligence process for deals we list.

  - Incentivised, fast and real time Investor relations with more transparency of information.

  As well as a token to be used by our investors on our existing online investment platform or our trading
  market the we plan to launch in 2018.


  Bnk To The Future is a platform that provides the environment for future financial and technology investments
  with professional investors. Having more than 10,000 BFTs on the platform allows access to future investment
  opportunities, allowing users to invest in innovative pin tech start-ups, vote on publicly traded shares.
  It is a system that allows professional investors investing in more than 60,000 PINTech, cryptography,
  and block chain companies on the BFT platform and has a preferred access to future transactions with
  10,000 BFT deposits. In 2018, we aim to establish a legitimate token market securities market. In particular,
  Simon Dixon, a block chain master, is a key member of the project team. In particular, the portfolio
