description: >-
  MUNCH ($MUNCH) is a digital currency that replaces the ‘bite’ taken by traditional financial systems
  and distributes it to community-chosen causes and in rewards to its users. By collecting a 5% transaction
  fee from all Munch transactions, rewards are distributed evenly between our community and an accredited
  charitable cause, decided by the community. On each transaction, the percentage distributed to charity
  is taken from the transaction and stored in the contract’s address, rather than a private wallet. Uniswap’s
  router’s functions convert the token to ETH and automatically send directly to the charity’s address.
