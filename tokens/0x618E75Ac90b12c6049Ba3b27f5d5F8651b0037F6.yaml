  QASH (pronounced “cash”) is the native currency for the Quoine (pronounced “coin”) which is now rebranded
  to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/quoine">Liquid</a>. Liquid is a global cryptocurrency
  firm looking to solve the liquidity problems that have surfaced with crypto investments. Liquid brings
  liquidity to the cryptocurrency space by providing a means for you to easily buy cryptocurrency with
  and cash-out to fiat. Currently, each crypto exchange has its own level of liquidity that differs between
  the trading pairs it offers. This creates individual silos that may have great liquidity on one exchange
  but not on another. The Liquid platform connects these silos into one combined pool to give you the
  greatest liquidity possible.


  The Liquid World Book compiles the orders and prices from exchanges around the world into one order
  book for you to use. This gives any trader, no matter their location, the ability to use the fiat currency
  of their choice when purchasing or selling crypto. It removes the liquidity silos of separate exchanges
  and gives more trading power to previously underserved markets. The Prime Brokerage half of the Quoine
  Liquid platform basically gives you access to the features outlined in the previous World Book section.
  With Prime Brokerage, you have direct market access to all exchanges in the World Book without having
  to create an account on each individual exchange. Furthermore, Quoine has been building partnerships
  with a network of banks over the last several years to ensure the quick transfer of your fiat funds.


  QASH is an <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=279&view=market">ERC20</a> token
  you use to pay for services on the Liquid platform. Beyond that, QASH holders may also receive discounts,
  promotional products, and ICO investment opportunities with coins that Quoine helps to launch. The team
  also emphasizes in their whitepaper that other organizations may use it for their own purposes similar
  to how some financial institutions use the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ripple">Ripple
  XRP token</a>. Because Quoine enters a few different financial sectors, the company has quite a few
  competitors. As a credit facility, the company competes with SALT. On the exchange side, there are numerous
  other businesses like <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance">Binance</a> specializing
  in alternative coins or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gemini">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gdax">Coinbase</a>
  focusing on fiat to crypto conversions.

   Mike Kayamori (CEO) and Mario Gomez Lozada (President and CTO) founded Quoine in 2014. Kayamori was
  previously a Senior Vice President at SoftBank Group and was the Chief Investment Officer of Gungho
  Asia. Lozada was the CTO of Merrill Lynch in Japan for 11 years before taking the Chief Information
  Officer role at Credit Suisse Japan. Quoine is the first cryptocurrency firm in the world to be officially
  licensed by the Japan Financial Services Agency (FSA). The Liquid platform is actually the result of
  combining two previous platforms, Quoinex and Qryptos. At one time, those two trading platforms were
  performing over $12 billion of transactions each year.
