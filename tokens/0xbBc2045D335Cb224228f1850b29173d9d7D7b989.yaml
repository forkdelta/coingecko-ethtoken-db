description: "Dear friends, we present to your attention the project, which has no ideological analogues\
  \ in the world at the moment.\nIf you are interested in charitable activities, you should already know\
  \ the difficulties and problems that arise on the way. One of these problems is the difficulty in financing\
  \ international charitable activities, primarily due to the lack of a centralized platform that allows\
  \ transactions to be carried out without any difficulties. As an example of this problem can be considered\
  \ incompatibility of payment systems with each other. Thus, VISA / MasterCard cards issued in Europe\
  \ are not accepted by US payment systems, and some payment systems may simply not be available in any\
  \ country.\nAlso, electronic payment systems, such as Advanced Cash, Payeer, PayPal and others - are\
  \ simply not compatible with each other, and accordingly, they imply transactions only between users\
  \ of the system itself. Of course, today there are questionable exchangers that offer exchange between\
  \ systems for an increased percentage. With cash, the situation is even more complex.  Well, the final\
  \ part of the problem lies in the fact that in recent years, our lives are increasingly included turnover\
  \ of cryptocurrencies.\nIn this regard, the dev team of HELP token project decided to start developing\
  \ a platform that solves all the problems of transactions for the needs of charity.\nA revolutionary\
  \ idea in this area will be to unite charity and the crypto industry, so we can make a huge step into\
  \ the future, and greatly simplify the implementation of international donations. \nThe developed platform\
  \ will carry out the sale and purchase of HELP token, using any cards, and the maximum number of payment\
  \ systems.\nThe platform will use blockchain technology, in a certain block of which there will be charitable\
  \ foundations and projects.\nAlso, our team will developed:\nHybrid mobile applications for using crypto\
  \ currency in charity.\nPlug - ins and widgets for sites that use payment gateways, and allow transfers\
  \ by pressing one or two buttons, with easy configuration and code implementation in the site.\nYes,\
  \ we create a brand that will be widely known in the field of charity, and, of course, will create the\
  \ most necessary, useful, functional and convenient tools for this!"
