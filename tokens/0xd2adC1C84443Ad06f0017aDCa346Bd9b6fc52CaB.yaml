  dFund is a project that aims to build an all-encompassing platform combining advanced DeFi smart-contract-powered
  features including decentralized hedge funds, direct p2p lending, credit scores, DAO governance and
  a secondary marketplace for synthetic assets into one easy to use platform.

  Every user on the platform will be able to start their own decentralized hedge fund, or invest in one,
  and decentralized hedge funds on the platform will be ranked by their performance (roi), so people can
  make informed decisions. The founder of the decentralized hedge fund can only swap / trade with user
  funds, while withdrawals and payouts are automated by smart contracts, therefore eliminating the possibility
  of scam or pyramid schemes.

  The platform will also enable users to participate in direct p2p lending, where every user sets the
  loan amount, interest rate, loan duration, and collateral requirement, which can be even under or over
  100% allowing for under and over collateralized loans. Every borrower on the platform will have a credit
  rating, and lenders can set the minimum credit rating required to take the loan, and even set different
  collateral requirements and interest rates for users with different credit ratings. If someone never
  got liquidated on their loan aka never defaulted and always paid back the loan amount + interest on
  time, they will have a very high credit rating, while users who get liquidated / default many times
  will see their credit rating slip down. Credit rating can be improved or worsened over time.

  The platform will also have a secondary marketplace for synthetic assets where users can buy and sell
  the loans, therefore allowing lenders to exit their positions and delegate the risk and waiting time
  to other users. So for example, if a user is lending a loan with a 10% interest rate, but they need
  money / liquidity urgently or they simply don’t want to wait until the end of the loan duration, they
  can instead decide to sell their loan, and maybe someone will buy it for 4% instantly, which would mean
  a 6% profit for them after they receive the original 10% interest at the end of the loan’s duration,
  which is beneficial for both a buyer and the seller. For the seller (the original lender), they don’t
  have to wait and they are getting a smaller profit with no risk, and for the buyer of the loan, they
  are receiving a higher profit for waiting until the end of the loan’s duration. This is in many ways
  similar to real life bond market.
