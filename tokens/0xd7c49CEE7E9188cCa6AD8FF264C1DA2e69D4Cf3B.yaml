description: >-
  Nexus Mutual is a decentralized insurance protocol built on Ethereum that currently offers cover for
  smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, currently covering all the main defi protocols. Nexus Mutual
  offers coverage against smart contract failures, which protects against potential bugs in smart contract
  code. 


  The coverage intends to provide protection against financial losses that may be incurred due to hacks
  or exploits in the smart contract code. Note that smart contract cover only protects against “unintended
  uses” of smart contracts, so security events such as the loss of private keys or centralized exchange
  hacks are not covered. In December 2020, it released custody cover covering centralised custodians and
  lenders such as Celsius, Blockfi, and Nexo.
