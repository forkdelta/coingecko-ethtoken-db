description: >-
  Mars Project combines standardized hashrate product and liquidity mining together, packing POW mining
  into an on-chain protocol. It provides a consistent POW mining output which could be acutely calculated
  in the very beginning, offering an edge for users on mining stability. 1 pETH18C represents 1MH/s real-world
  Ether mining power. No more complicated variables on daily mining from now on. On the other hand, MARS
  token would be distributed to users in this project. Earning reward from staking and liquidity providing
  (LP), shorten the distance of DeFi to Bitcoin community.
