  COW is a new blockchain system that offers a discounted commission to users and a continuous passive
  income to referees. The demand for COW will increase along with the growth of the Coweyeâ€™s crypto casino
  platform.


  By using COW, users will be able to receive 30% discounts on every commission within the platform, as
  the user pool increases the demand for COW will rise. Therefore the value of the COW will go up. We
  also offer referral programs where users can receive 10% of the total betting commission of the referred
  users played. The referees can make additional income continuously.


  To make COW even more attractive, we are currently negotiating a partnership deals with offline casinos
  to use COW as chips in partnered offline casinos as well.
