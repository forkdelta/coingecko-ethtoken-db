  Nami.Trade is a decentralized trading platform enabling traders to trade forex, crypto, indices, commodities
  under contract for difference mechanism. Nami ICO token (NAC) is the liquidating currency within the
  platform. Currently, trading in the financial markets must go through brokerage firms, from stocks,
  bonds to currencies or commodities. The operation of these firms/platforms costs a lot of money in infrastructures,
  operating, selling and other expenses. These costs are charged to traders on each trading volume of
  their transaction, under different names as spread, swap, commission, tax, etc. Not to mention that
  there is a lack of transparency as brokerages can provide inaccurate prices, change spread or take opposite
  sides of traders’ trades. These not only reduce traders’ trust but also hurt them and have negative
  impacts on their’s trading performance.


  Blockchain will be the “ledger” to record all transactions of investors. This data is constantly being
  updated and maintained by peer-to-peer computer network around the world.


  In addition, nami.trade uses Smart Contract technology – a decentralized application based in dispersed
  blocks of blockchain. The basic idea behind a smart contract is that transactions between two or more
  relating parties can be verified through blockchain, instead of a centralized program like traditional
  brokers.

  Picture that, in order to ensure the security of a contract, we will need legal experts to compile and
  third parties to help implement it, in traditional ways. Moreover, if any problems with the contract,
  we will need to base on judicial system to solve it, which is time-consuming and costly.


  Whereas, smart contract of nami.trade is executed on Ethereum’s blockchain network, which specifies
  the terms of the deal and penalties in the event of breach. Smart contract can not be modified by any
  object, once deployed. Therefore, its ensures the safety and transparency in all transactions of investors
  on nami.trade.
