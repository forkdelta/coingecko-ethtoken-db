description: >-
  Users are incentivised to stake Uniswap liquidity provider tokens. Fees from these tokens are farmed.
  A percentage of these fees goes toward the autonomous strategies like liquidating LP tokens, and performing
  an (`ETH-ETHY`) buy back (increasing the price). Any purchased ETHY tokens will be distributed to stakers/farmers


  ETHY implements a strong deflationary force on each token. Every time an ETHY token is transferred,
  a small fee is taken, which is returned to the farmers. This mechanism incentivises holding and farming.


  ETHY holders will be able to vote on proposalsâ€“ so long as they have staked liquidity in the pools.
  The community will decide everything from developer fees and site design to the exact farming options
  available.
