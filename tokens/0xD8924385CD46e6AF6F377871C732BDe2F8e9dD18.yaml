  Pylon Network's blockchain is designed to play the role of the digital communication platform in the
  energy sector, simplifying communication processes between all its stakeholders. Essentially, Pylon
  Network is a Neutral Energy DataHub, supported by its decentralized Federated Nodes.


  All Federated Nodes of Pylon Network are required to stake Pylon Tokens ($PYLNT) for becoming part of
  the network and will receive 80% of the rewards in the form of Pyloncoin ($PYLNC) - the utility coin
  of Pylon's Neutral Data Hub.
