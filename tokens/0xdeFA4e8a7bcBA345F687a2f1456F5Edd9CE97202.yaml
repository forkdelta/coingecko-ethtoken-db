description: >-
  Following KyberDAOâ€™s approval of KIP-6, the KNC token will undergo a migration to make KNC more dynamic
  and flexible with the ability to support more efficient upgrades. To avoid confusion, the old token
  should be labeled as KNC Legacy (KNCL) and the new token will retain the original ticker KNC. Migration
  instructions can be found below
