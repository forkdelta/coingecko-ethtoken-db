  By coupling the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, Robocalls 2.0
  will use its unique AI algorithm to scan through its user established and blockchain secured spam call
  ID database, to predict unwanted calls based on inbound dialing patterns. The structure relies on the
  Ethereum blockchain to validate, notify, and block this activity. Leveraging this powerful technology,
  our algorithm will create the biggest predicted black list database of unwanted and scam numbers in
  the blockchain.
