  Guarded Ethers ($GETH) are ERC20 tokens issued by Guarda Wallet. The tokens are sent by Guardaâ€™s smart-contract
  to those who stake their ETH to Guarda ETH staking pool. Users will receive GETH in a 1:1 ratio to ETH
  for their staked ETH and as staking rewards. Once the ETH 2.0 chain is completely launched users will
  be able to exchange GETH tokens for ETH. Also, users will have an opportunity to trade GETH on DeFi
  exchanges.
