description: >-
  O3 Swap, a proprietary cross-chain aggregation protocol, was designed to achieve more efficient trading
  pathways using 2 solutions. The first solution is Liquidity Aggregation - aggregating the liquidity
  source across leading Decentralized Exchanges(DEXs) from mainstream blockchains. Another part is Cross-Chain
  Exchange - implementing cross-chain protocols that allow DeFi users to freely exchange cross-chain assets
  with one click within their own wallet.


  There are plenty of sources available in the cryptocurrency market, especially with the emerging burst
  of Layer 2 projects on Ethereum as well as decentralized environments such as chainBinance Smart Chain
  and Huobi Eco Chain. These chains are independent from each other, the assets of which are not interconvertible.
  O3 Swap is changing the game in an effort to realize the interconversion of assets from separate chains.
  At the same time, O3 aggregator provides the best price quote from more than 10 DEXs for users who are
  seeking for the best price.
