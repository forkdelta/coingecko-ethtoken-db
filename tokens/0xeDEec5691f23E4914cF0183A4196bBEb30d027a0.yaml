description: >-
  $WSTA is a wrapped version of $STA token, currently at 1:1. It works similar to WETH with the unique
  feature of ""safe deflation"", as opposed  to $STA which can be taken advantage of as a result of the
  deflationary feature. $WSTA can safely enable burning of $STA, and can be safely used on other DEX aggregators
  such as Balancer, 1inch, Matcha, etc.
