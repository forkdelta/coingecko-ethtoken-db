description: >-
  Bankera is an operational fork of SpectroCoin. As SpectroCoin to be competitive has developed bank-like
  infrastructure, but was not intended to become a proper bank, it is releasing Bankera to leverage its
  regulatory and IT infrastructure to develop a bank for the blockchain era. Bankera as a proper bank
  will offer payments, investments, and loan and deposit solutions. Later on, it is planing to develop
  new types of money, such as inflation linked baskets.
