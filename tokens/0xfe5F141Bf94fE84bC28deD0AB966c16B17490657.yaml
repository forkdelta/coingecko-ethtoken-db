  Libra Credit is a decentralized lending ecosystem that facilitates open access to credit anywhere and
  anytime based on the Ethereum blockchain. Libra Credit is a global initiative with a mission to provide
  financial inclusion and lower the cost of financial services. Powered by its proprietary big data, AI-based
  credit assessment technology and existing global partnership networks, Libra Credit has the expertise
  and capabilities to realize its mission. Libra Credit aims to offer a seamless digital lending process
  that can be completed in 5 steps: application, verification and credit assessment, confirmation, collateral
  deposit, and disbursement. The Libra Credit platform will focus on a dual-credit risk scoring mechanism
  that considers the creditworthiness of the pledged collateral as well as the credit information of the
  borrower. Borrowers will be able to pledge any crypto-assets as collateral and receive loans in their
  desired asset. Using smart contracts and a proprietary collateral valuation and liquidation system,
  Libra Credit will lock in agreed terms between borrows, lenders, custodians, guarantors and liquidators.


  Libra Credit was founded in 2017 and operates out of San Francisco, USA. They are backed by investors
  such as FBG Capital, GBIC, DHVC, Dekypt Capital, Crypto Parency, and others. Lu Hua, Co-Founder & CEO
  has experience in the payments, financing, and risk management industries. He was previously the CEO
  of moKredit, one of China’s top digital credit servicing companies. Lu was also the Head of Core Payments
  for PayPal China and the Head of Global Banking Platform for PayPal US. Dan Schatt, Co-Founder & COO
  has previously worked as the Chief Commercial Officer at Stockpile Inc., a leading fintech company,
  and as General Manager of Financial Innovations at PayPal. Howard Wu, Chief Scientist, he is a blockchain
  and cryptography expert who is a Founding Partner of Dekrypt Capital, Advisor of Blockchain at Berkeley,
  and Software Engineer at Google. He advises the project in a technical capacity and has received a Master’s
  degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences from UC Berkeley.


  There are already quite a few blockchain lending projects, so competition is stiff. Libra Credit’s development
  progress is rather early compared to its competitors. The crypto-to-crypto lending part seems to be
  well thought out. However, not so much with the crypto-to-fiat part. According to the roadmap, crypto-to-fiat
  lending is scheduled to launch in 2018 Q3. With details lacking in the weekly blog update about crypto-to-fiat
  lending, it is difficult to gauge whether the proposed timeline is reasonable.
