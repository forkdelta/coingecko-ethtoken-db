description: >-
  ATF farms secure the automated growth of cannabis, tomatoes, cucumbers and many more plants. This reaps
  the full benefits of LED lighting for growing and hydroponics technologies. ATF indoor appliances need
  minimal customer involvement during the vegetation process and donâ€™t require any specific knowledge
  in agronomy or advanced experience. ATF is the first token that allows the blockchain community to have
  easy access to advanced technologies in automated agro cultivation equipment manufacturing.
