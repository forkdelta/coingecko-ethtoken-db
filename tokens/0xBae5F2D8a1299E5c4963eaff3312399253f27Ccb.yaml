description: >-
  SOAR is an ERC-20 with a frictionless yield generator mechanism that applies a 1% fee on every transfer
  and instantly distributes the fee among holders. This is the easiest form of staking that exists today.
  Holders do not need to deposit tokens anywhere and wait for fees to be delivered. Fees are awarded by
  the smart contract and automatically reflected in the holderâ€™s balance. There is no inflation in SOAR,
  as the same tokens are redistributed among holders based on transaction volume.
