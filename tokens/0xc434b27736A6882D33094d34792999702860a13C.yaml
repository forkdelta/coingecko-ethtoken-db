  Savix is a token with a predictable inflation mechanic built into the ERC-20 protocol. Newly generated
  tokens get distributed evenly to all wallets free of any gas/fees. A user has to simply hold the coin
  to receive his share every 2 hours.


  The yearly inflation rate starts at 85% and decreases over time to 8% after 5 years.
