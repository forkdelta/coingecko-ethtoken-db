  Inverse BNB by Synthetix


  Inversely tracks the price of Binance Coin through price feeds supplied by an oracle. Its value freezes
  when it reaches its upper limit of $38 (i.e. when Binance Coin’s value reaches $13) or its lower limit
  of $13 (i.e. when Binance Coin’s value reaches $13). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen,
  it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths
  at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted
  for another iBNB with different limits.
