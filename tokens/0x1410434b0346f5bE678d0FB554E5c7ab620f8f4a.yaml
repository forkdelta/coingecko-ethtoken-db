  The token is called "KAN". A strict limit of 10 billion KAN will be issued, and will never be increased.  KAN
  will be issued according to the Ethereum ERC 20 standard. KAN's profit comes mainly from the payment
  fees, exchange fees and membership service fees from the BITKAN platform.

  crytocurrency-concentrated & content payment community. KAN will be online as the same time as the "K
  Site" feature, which is scheduled in May 2018.
