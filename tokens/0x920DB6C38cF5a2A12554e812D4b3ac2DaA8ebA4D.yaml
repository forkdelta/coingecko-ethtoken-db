description: >-
  Evimeria is the bridge between generosity, and the people who need it the most. We will use the blockchain
  to track transactions, verify the legitimacy of charities and ensure the safety of donations. The purpose
  of the Evimeria Platform is to bring transparency and accountability to the field of charitable donations
  in an effort to stem corruption by allowing incoming cryptocurrency donations for specific causes or
  campaigns to be permanently viewable, audit-able and traceable.
