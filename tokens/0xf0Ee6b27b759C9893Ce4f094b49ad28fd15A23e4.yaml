description: >-
  Enigma is a crypto platform that’s trying to solve the problem of privacy on the blockchain by giving
  them access to much-needed storage, privacy, and scalability. Enigma wants to extend Ethereum Smart
  Contracts by introducing secret contracts, a brand of smart contract that gives users an element of
  privacy that’s not intrinsic to current blockchain protocols. These contracts operate off-chain, meaning
  the execution of the Smart Contract doesn’t occur on the Ethereum blockchain itself. This is how the
  Enigma protocol works: it breaks up the Smart Contract and any related data into pieces, encrypts those
  pieces, and distributes them redundantly among Enigma nodes.


  Enigma has a protocol level. The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive
  data. It has a platform layer too. On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and
  AI exchanges can be built. In its application layer, it enables thousands of truly decentralized apps
  that require private computation and secure data.Its first application is catalyst. Catalyst is the
  first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users.
  Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional
  crypto traders.


  Enigma has a team of MIT graduates, and they’ve been working diligently to ensure Enigma’s success.
  Guy Zyskind, Enigma’s CEO and cofounder, helped start the project while he was still a student at MIT.
  He has more than a decade of software development experience with an M.S. from MIT. Sandy Pentland,
  a well known MIT data scientist who gained fame for his work in data-mining social interactions, is
  Zyskind and Nathan’s adviser on Enigma. With other advisors such as Alex Pentland, who sits on the Advisory
  Boards for Google and Nissan, CEO of Abra, Bill Barhydt and director of MIT media lab, Prof. Alex Pentland,
  it is hard to difficult a fault in the team.
