  Blank is the most private, non-custodial Ethereum browser extension wallet.


  Blank allows the user to easily interact with privacy smart contracts on Ethereum to hide the amounts
  and the origins of cryptocurrency held, in a decentralized, non-custodial, and frictionless manner.


  Blank solves the problem of privacy in crypto transactions. Each time you want to make a withdrawal,
  Blank will create a new wallet address for you with the amount of crypto that you requested. This address
  originates from the smart contract where everyoneâ€™s funds are pooled. All of this is achieved using
  cryptographic proofs to ensure that the user cannot be linked with the original depositing address.
