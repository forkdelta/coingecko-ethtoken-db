  The Atari Token’s mission is to bring decentralization and universality to the video game and interactive
  entertainment industry. The goal of the Atari Token is to be the utility token of reference within the
  video game and interactive entertainment world, either as an in-game token or as a means of exchange
  for services or products between individuals and/or companies. Atari aims to provide participants with
  the tools necessary to effectively use smart contracts and smart platforms and reach mass adoption as
  quickly as possible. The Atari Group has recently entered into many partnership agreements to progressively
  develop the adoption and the use cases of the Atari Token. The Atari Token is issued by Atari Chain,
  Ltd (Gibraltar). For more information about the Atri Token, please visit the official Atari website.
