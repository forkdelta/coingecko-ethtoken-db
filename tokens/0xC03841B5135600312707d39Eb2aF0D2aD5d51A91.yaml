  "Deflationary token, secured with a basket of cryptocurrencies, with the possibility of staking.


  BasketCoin is: Deflationary, With collateral - covering its value, With the system of repurchase and
  burning of BSKT tokens.


  A fee of 2% of the value of each transaction will be taken from the transfer - half is burned out, the
  other half goes to the staking/reward redistribution pool which indeed speeds up the process of reducing
  supply. Smart Contract itself assumes that a total of 90% of all BSKT will be burned -> supply will
  decrease from 21,000,000 to 2,100,000


  The BSKT token is secured with a basket of seven cryptocurrencies that cover its value. The security
  so adopted is intended to ensure a constant and stable increase in the value of tokens. Thanks to the
  correct match of coins in our basket, its value is less susceptible to fluctuations appearing in the
  cryptocurrency market. The BSKT token security chart looks like this:


  Bitcoin (BTC) – responsible for 25% of the value of the coverage,

  Ethereum (ETH) – responsible for 25% of the coverage value,

  Polkadot (DOT) – responsible for 10% of the coverage value, Smarkey (SKEY) – responsible for 10% of
  the coverage value, YfDAI.finance (YF-DAI) – responsible for 10% of the coverage value, USD Coin (USDC)
  – responsible for 10% of the coverage value, Basketcoin (BSKT) – responsible for 10% of the coverage
  value.


  All listed cryptocurrencies that make up the BSKT basket will be used to generate additional profits
  on platforms such as:

  Crypto.com (profits of 3%-12% APR), YF-DAI (profits up to 72% APR), Swissborg (profits up to 20% APR),
  and other decentralised profit-generating platforms in DeFi format.


  Revenues from these platforms will be used in the repurchase process for the redemption and burning
  of BSKT tokens, contributing to a significant reduction in supply on the secondary market. 90% of the
  above profits will be used for repurchase and burnout, while the remaining 10% will be used for ongoing
  and necessary expenses related"
