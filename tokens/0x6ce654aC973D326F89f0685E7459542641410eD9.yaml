  HubDAO proposes a solution to aggregate lending, which can aggregate the lending liquidity of Compound,

  AAVE and other DEFI applications. HubDAO also runs its own lending platform, lending zone, to provide
  users

  with more personalized services. In addition, users who provide liquidity to HubDAO can also participate
  in

  farming and receive additional rewards. But most importantly, HubDAO adopts the organizational mode
  of DAO

  (decentralized autonomous organization) to best optimize for democratic governance.

  HubDAO is aiming to build a Decentralized Financial Autonomous Organization ecosystem. The Hub refers
  to

  the hub of the ""hub and spoke (H&S) system,"" which is like the central point at which various spokes
  on a bike

  wheel converge.

  The DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is quite different from the common company organization,

  which is often a centralized management that makes decisions based on the opinions and the votes of
  the top

  leaders of the company. Thus, in order to decentralize the decision-making of the DAO, the operation
  and

  development of overall governance depends on the distribution of the votes to enable a complete direct
  democratic

  governance system. However, the problem is that the efficiency is low and it is difficult to count everyoneâ€™s
  votes.

  The Blockchain technology makes this DAO vision possible, as the voting system on the chain is efficient.

  Individuals can show different voting weights by holding onto different numbers of tokens.

  Hence, HubDAO is a decentralized ecosystem in which the volunteers participate in the management by
  using

  the blockchain technology to build a community operation and autonomous decentralized financial ecosystem

  based on direct democratic governance. HubDAO improves the external scalability of the original decentralized

  finance system by combining various external platforms, financial services and hub and spoke (H & S)
  system.
