description: >-
  Derivex aims to utilise the ERC20 asset class to provide a facility that offers classes of products
  such as derivatives and margin trades, which in turn allows the more sophisticated investor to manage
  their portfolios more efficiently and effectively as well as opening up further routes for speculation.


  The decentralised, trustless nature of our offerings means that individuals will always retain complete
  control over their assets throughout the trade.


  The more traditional blockchain based trading systems currently cater predominantly to the less experienced
  trader, but opening up these more sophisticated financial products opens up a vastly lucrative market.
  Read the whitepaper for details on how our blockchain-driven financial instruments fit together to form
  a revolutionary approach to derivatives trading.
