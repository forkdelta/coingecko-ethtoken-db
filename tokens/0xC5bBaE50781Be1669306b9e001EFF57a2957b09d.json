The team at AIG comprises of crypto-technology and blockchain enthusiasts.\n\nAndy saw potential in designing a decentralized network powered by the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> blockchain to fix the current broken content monetization model with a better model. Most people introduced to the global content industry will identify the following problems with the current model:\nThe Gifto network was launched in December 2017 and has been tested along with AIG\u2019s flagship product, Uplive.  Uplive is a live streaming mobile application with over 20 million users.\n\nAn official Gifto report in February 2018, stated that Gifto featured in the top 10 traded cryptocurrencies by volume. The universal blockchain-based virtual gifting protocol has not only bridged the gap between content creators and the audience but has also introduced a way to acknowledge and reward the content creators. Besides monetizing decentralized content, it has revamped the modern creator-audience relationship.\n\nIt has already received support from a number of large institutional investors including KPCB and Wicklow Capital. This can only be seen a positive for Gifto as it proves that the idea has been scrutinized and accepted by a fairly large number of people.","developer_score":15.376,"id":"gifto","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1359/large/gifto.png?1547742697","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1359/small/gifto.png?1547742697","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1359/thumb/gifto.png?1547742697"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2356301,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5bbae50781be1669306b9e001eff57a2957b09d","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc5bbae50781be1669306b9e001eff57a2957b09d"],"facebook_username":"gifto.io","homepage":["https://gifto.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/GIFTO-io/GiftoSmartContract"]},"twitter_screen_name":"GIFTO_io"},"liquidity_score":39.87,"market_cap_rank":432,"name":"Gifto","public_interest_score":0.001,"symbol":"gto","tickers":[{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"bancor","name":"Bancor Network"},"target":"BNT"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GTO-908","market":{"identifier":"binance_dex","name":"Binance DEX"},"target":"BNB"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"bittrex","name":"Bittrex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"nice_hash","name":"NiceHash"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"okex_korea","name":"OKEx Korea"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"GTO","market":{"identifier":"upbit_indonesia","name":"Upbit Indonesia "},"target":"BTC"}]}
