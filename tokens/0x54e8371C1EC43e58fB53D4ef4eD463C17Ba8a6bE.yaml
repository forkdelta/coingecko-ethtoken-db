description: >-
  The ETH 26 Day EMA Crossover Yield Set attempts to capitalize on shorter term trends and accumulate
  ETH. ETHEMAAPY automatically triggers rebalances when the price of ETH crosses the 26 Day Exponential
  Moving Average (26 EMA) indicating a trend reversal. If the price of Ethereum crosses and stays below
  the 26 EMA, the Set rebalances from ETH into Compound USDC and automatically accrues interest on your
  dollars when the market is bearish. Link to more details.
