  Graviton is a wrapped tokensâ€™ liquidity incentivization solution that aggregates multiple cross-chain
  bridges and creates a reward-based economy around asset wrapping.

  Graviton provides governance tools for boosting cross-chain liquidity for wrapped digital assets and
  increasing their yield via GTON reward and governance token. Thereby, Graviton's primary aim is to unite
  the isolated communities of different blockchain projects like chains, AMMs, farms, and tokens.


  Graviton organizes Catalyst, a range of 1-2 weeks-long programs aimed at incentivizing communities of
  new tokenized projects to boost their initial liquidity on multiple chains.
