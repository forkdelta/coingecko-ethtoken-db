  At bounty0x we are building a platform enabling startups to post bounty tasks which bounty hunters will
  be able to accept and complete. Bounty0x makes it easier for users seeking to complete bounties to search
  and accept bounties. The benefit of this approach are twofold. First, this allows startups to focus
  exclusively on developing their product, and second, it makes it easier for bounty hunters to find new
  campaigns to join. Startups and bounty hunters have an economic interest to use our platform. In the
  same way that miners take a fee for every verified transaction, "bounty sheriffs" take a small fee for
  every verified bounty task they review correctly. By using the bounty0x platform, startups will have
  access to a pool of reputable bounty hunters, and a verification mechanism to ensure the tasks are performed
  accordingly.
