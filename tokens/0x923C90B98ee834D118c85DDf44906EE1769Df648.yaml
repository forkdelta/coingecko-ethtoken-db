  While existing solutions offer to solve just one problem at a time, our team is up to build a secure,
  useful, & easy-to-use product based on private blockchain. It will include easy cryptocurrency payments
  integration, and even a digital arbitration system.


  At the end, Our aims to integrate all companies, employees, and business assets into a unified blockchain
  ecosystem, which will make business truly efficient, transparent, and reliable.


  What is Qitcoin Exchange? Qitcoin Exchange is intended to stop transaction fees on all trades made on
  the exchange platform and allow free trading on a secure blockchain.


  In the end, we made a Digital Asset called Qitcoin (QTC) to trade on the Exchange. Qitcoin is also used
  for voting. Each member can add their favorite coins or tokens by choosing to use Qitcoin (QTC).
