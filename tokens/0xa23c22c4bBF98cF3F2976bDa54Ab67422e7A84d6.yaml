description: >-
  Today, privacy remains one of the most important tasks for every user. Unfortunately, Internet surfing
  leaves a huge number of traces for further identification of the user.


  We provide VPN and proxy services that negate content restrictions and censorship to allow unlimited
  access to videos, music, social networks, and more from anywhere in the world.


  We respect our customers, so we do not store or register traffic information, DNS queries, or any other
  data that can be used by hackers.


  The SVN token is the basis for user interaction with the system and acts as a Commission cost, which
  is charged from each participant in the chain who wants to maintain their anonymity, and then redistributed
  between the provider and the server holders.
