  Tokenized NO shares in Augur's 2020 U.S. presidential election market.

  At any point in time, the token price signals the market's perceived probability of Trump losing the
  election. For example, if the token is trading at .54 DAI, that signals roughly 54% odds of Trump losing
  the election.

  If Trump loses the election, each share is redeemable for one DAI and if he wins, for zero DAI.
