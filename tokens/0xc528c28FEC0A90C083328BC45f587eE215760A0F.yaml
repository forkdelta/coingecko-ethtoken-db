description: >-
  Endor.coin is reinventing predictive analytics by democratizing access to Artificial Intelligence data
  analysis, making it accessible, trustless, censorship-resistance and useful for all. This is achieved
  through the Endor.coin Protocol, offering the world’s first automated, self-served, predictive platform
  that allows business users and unprofessional crypto-token holders alike to ask complex predictive questions
  and obtain high-quality results in minutes. This aims to democratize the field of Data Science, that
  today is reserved mostly for Fortune500 companies. Endor.coin is based on the novel science of Social
  Physics developed at MIT by the project’s team members Prof. Alex Pentland and Dr. Yaniv Altshuler
