description: >-
  This project is based on an existing Forex broker (in the market since 2004). The startup is designed
  to transfer the existing business model into the crypto environment. According to the Roadmap, the current
  technological practices and equipment will serve as a base for the broker’s new separate division, where
  all the operations with traders’ accounts will be processed in cryptocurrencies only. The new division
  will be called LH-CRYPTO, it will be distinct from the main brand legally and financially. #LHCoin will
  be used as margin requirement for trading on Forex, CFDs and crypto markets. Also, it will be used as
  agent’s commission for LH-Crypto partners.
