  Funder One/FUNDX replaces the need for banks by making its members a true Trustor. Members can work
  with us to create the instruments necessary for a real estate transaction.


  Funder One/FUNDX can now tokenize the property, create liquidity, and eliminate the debt.


  A five year membership fee guarantees Funder Oneâ€™s members to own their home after the five years, without
  the fear of losing their home to foreclosure. After five years, the members will also be able to use
  all equity on their property.
