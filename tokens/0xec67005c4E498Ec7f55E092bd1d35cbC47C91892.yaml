  The fast-growing demand for cryptocurrencies calls for a convenient way to administer them. Melon is
  one such platform that works through a blockchain protocol allowing easy and efficient maintenance of
  cryptocurrencies. Acting as a hedge fund, Melon presents a fully customizable administration of your
  digital assets. You can use it as an online vault that allows you to store and transact your funds through
  its web portal. Melon was developed to meet the need for a cost-efficient and technologically advanced
  hedge fund to manage digital assets. Reto Trinkler and Mona El Isa founded the company, Melonport AG
  in July 2016.


  The company created Melon as a digital asset management protocol. It is a first of its kind system that
  enables the users to store, administer, and invest in crypto assets through a decentralized network.
  Melon works through a fully decentralized infrastructure. All the information of the user, such as smart
  contracts, assets, and records are saved on a decentralized blockchain network. It not only offers reliability
  for the storage of information but also reduces the risk of custody. The protocol also offers a decentralized
  system of execution through the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts are distributed across
  multiple <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> networks to provide better
  efficiency and security for the assets. With the Melon protocol, users can save both time and money
  for investing in a hedge fund. Additionally, there is no requirement of a third party approval from
  a lawyer or advisor.


  Melon’s <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/ico/melon">ICO</a> was launched in February 2017 and sold
  out within 10 minutes. Melonport is aiming to bridge the gap between the portfolio managers and the
  investors by removing the role of the third parties such as law firms. Melonport’s CEO, Mona El Isa
  comes from a strong financial background and is versed with the problems of the investment industry.


  There is still a lot of work to be done on the Melon project, even though things are looking quite positive
  already. An audit of the protocol has been completed already, and the project continues to advance.
  No further specifics have been provided on the website, although it remains to be seen what the future
  holds. Bringing more value to Melon Coin would be a good idea, yet it remains to be seen how that might
  be achieved.
