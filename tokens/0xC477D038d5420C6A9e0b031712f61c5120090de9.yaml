description: >-
  Boson Protocol is a trust minimised and cost minimised protocol that automates digital to physical redemptions
  using NFTs encoded with game theory.


  Boson Protocolâ€™s vision is to enable a decentralized commerce ecosystem by funding and accelerating
  the development of a stack of specialist applications to disrupt, unbundle and democratize commerce.


  What is needed is a way to execute commerce transactions trustlessly with minimized human intermediaries
  or arbitrators. Our core technology disrupts e-commerce platforms by tokenizing real-world products
  and services and commerce data within a liquid digital market, built on DeFi. We call this decentralized
  autonomous commerce.
