It achieves second-level confirmation, no data explosion , no communication delay. In addition,Nerthus achieves that users store their own data and unified witness. Nerthus realizes weak centralized witness through witnesses, which ensuring the order and unification of the network and distributed execution so that can improve network performance and achieve distributed shard storage.\n\nWe believe that to solve the bottleneck of blockchain technology, we must optimize and reform the network architecture, data storage and operational mechanism. So on the bottom layer, DAG data structure is used; in the aspect of operation mechanism, a more distributed operating mechanism is designed, that is, everyone can be a witness, and everyone's witness is different; in terms of data storage, Nerthus adopts out-of-chain data storage,which means that users can store their own data. So even if the total amount of data is very large, it will not affect the operating mechanism of the entire network.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"nerthus","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9729/large/CQkdd1mCmLak2H8HWouf-C0uufsreKNR5eiLRn1NxMWqCC9ikNGCXgxM0hobTm7LMSqTqMsez1b_2w48as5x_izmXnerPvSsjkgVW_TKl3SL8kbDYvivexorvyp7AxxZPvEhyQxOMR3f_y5U30ngqjpnpwjOl8L002eXuZm81oNP4QCGGAad7oY2Hb5RAGtvphRB8hiNh-y9MCE9jH.jpg?1571303835","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9729/small/CQkdd1mCmLak2H8HWouf-C0uufsreKNR5eiLRn1NxMWqCC9ikNGCXgxM0hobTm7LMSqTqMsez1b_2w48as5x_izmXnerPvSsjkgVW_TKl3SL8kbDYvivexorvyp7AxxZPvEhyQxOMR3f_y5U30ngqjpnpwjOl8L002eXuZm81oNP4QCGGAad7oY2Hb5RAGtvphRB8hiNh-y9MCE9jH.jpg?1571303835","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9729/thumb/CQkdd1mCmLak2H8HWouf-C0uufsreKNR5eiLRn1NxMWqCC9ikNGCXgxM0hobTm7LMSqTqMsez1b_2w48as5x_izmXnerPvSsjkgVW_TKl3SL8kbDYvivexorvyp7AxxZPvEhyQxOMR3f_y5U30ngqjpnpwjOl8L002eXuZm81oNP4QCGGAad7oY2Hb5RAGtvphRB8hiNh-y9MCE9jH.jpg?1571303835"},"links":{"announcement_url":["http://bbs.nerthus.io/news/","https://medium.com/@NerthusOfficial"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x3dfeaf13a6615e560aecc5648ace8fa50d7cf6bf"],"homepage":["https://nerthusfoundation.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/nerthus-foundation-ltd/dochub"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Nerthus/","telegram_channel_identifier":"nerthuschain","twitter_screen_name":"Nerthusfans"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Nerthus","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"nts","tickers":[{"base":"0X3DFEAF13A6615E560AECC5648ACE8FA50D7CF6BF","market":{"identifier":"uniswap","name":"Uniswap (v2)"},"target":"ETH"}]}
