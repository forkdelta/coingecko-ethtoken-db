  “institutional-class endurance” with cross-blockchain compatibility.The currency is being developed
  by Bloq, which announced Metronome in October 2017. Metronome is launched in early December 2017, with
  the first cross-chain transfers (between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic) scheduled for Q1 2018.


  Metronome released in December 2017. By Q1 2018, Metronome aims to become the world’s first cross-chain
  compatible cryptocurrency by adding <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-classic">Ethereum
  Classic</a> support (the currency is initially built on <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>).

  and entering a new chain.
