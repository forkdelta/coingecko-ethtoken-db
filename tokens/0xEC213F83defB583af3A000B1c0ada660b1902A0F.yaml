  Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members with Presearch Tokens
  for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform. In a world where one company controls
  77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively
  acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is
  a necessity. Presearch has an innovative go-to-market strategy to target the most frequent searchers
  - web workers - and gain early adoption, on our way to releasing future versions of the open source
  platform that will utilize a blockchain-based index, curated by the community.
