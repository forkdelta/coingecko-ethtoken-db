  The goal of Polar Chain is to make a more efficient, stable, and scientifically sound edge computing
  platform with blockchain technology. To comply with the original purpose of the blockchain “Everyone
  is equal” and realize the Proof of Useful Work (PoUW). Polar Chain collects idle resources such as bandwidth,
  computing, storage, etc., so that everyone becomes an edge computing node and each edge node can process,
  execute and gain revenue. We rely on a myriad of nodes to form a decentralized peer-to-peer edge computing
  platform, which eventually becomes the super edge cloud—Polar Chain.


  Polar Chain is committed to building a complete ecosystem within the decentralized peer-to-peer edge
  platform, refactoring the existing Internet model, achieving value circulation and enhancement, and
  completing the “last mile” of Web 3.0.
