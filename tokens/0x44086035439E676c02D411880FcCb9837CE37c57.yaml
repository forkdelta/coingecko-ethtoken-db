description: >-
  The aim of the Uniswap State Dollar (uSD) protocol is to build the most secure and resilient stablecoin
  on Ethereumâ€”ever. Independent from any off-chain issuer, it is fortified against the risks inherent
  to all other stablecoins, and free of the anxiety that pervades the industry.


  uSD achieves this unprecedented level of stability by collateralizing other stablecoins. If any of them
  lose value or fail, it can simply rebalance itself to leverage the security of the others. And to account
  for excess due to fees in their pools, it can rebalance itself in another way.
