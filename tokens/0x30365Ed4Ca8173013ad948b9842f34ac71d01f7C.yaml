  Dirham Crypto is a platform for REPO (Repurchase Agreement) bonds in the blockchain ecosystem. Dirham
  Crypto aims to create a fully backed stablecoin combining the two worlds of fiat money and Cryptocurrencies
  based on REPO contracts. While other stablecoins distribute the profit earned by the custody of fiat
  money to stakeholders, Dirham Crypto enables all the clients to have a share of that profit, which is
  at least 4% APY. It means anyone who holds any amount of Dirham in his/her wallet will receive at least
  4% interest on specified maturity dates without staking or locking the fund in any third-party vault.
  Dir-ham coin is a fully backed stablecoin on Ethereum (ERC20) also ready to deploy on Tron network (TRC20)
  blockchains, each coin equals one AED (United Arab Emirateâ€™s Dirham), and is redeemable to fiat or other
  Cryptocurrencies by brokers in several countries around the world. Transferring and saving funds is
  without any fees on the Dirham Crypto platform.
