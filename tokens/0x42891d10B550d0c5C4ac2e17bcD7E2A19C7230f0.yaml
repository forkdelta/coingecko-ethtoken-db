description: >-
  Decentralised financial products launched on Ethereum brought new spaces for potentially fraudulent
  actions. That includes liquidity pools locking, PnDs (pump and dump), hard and soft rug-pulls, and many
  other. As many new DeFi projects suffered from various bad outcomes, which often resulted in obtaining
  investor funds, other legitimate ideas need to deal with FUD (fear, uncertainty disbelief), rather than
  focus on further project development.


  DAXHUND project is introduced to address these difficulties. Our dAPP will revolutionize the due-diligence
  process for early investors, keeping them away from cryptoscams.
