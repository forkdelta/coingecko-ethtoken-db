  AdEx (ADX) stands for “advertising exchange.” After a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2017, AdEx
  was the first startup to release an open-source protocol for decentralized advertising in 2018 and the
  first ad network  processing payments on the Ethereum blockchain.


  By using payment channels, AdEx ensures full transparency for all involved parties. Moreover, AdEx is
  using its own Layer-2 scaling solution called OUTPACE to facilitate micropayments per impression between
  its advertisers and publishers, processing more than 2,5 million transactions daily.


  After successful beta tests, AdEx Network released the AdEx Platform in 2020 and scaled it to 7,000
  registered advertisers and publishers generating more than 70 million monthly impressions. In August
  2020 AdEx started incentivized staking and liquidity providing programs for the $ADX token, interacting
  with the DeFi ecosystem and engaging its community into actively supporting the stability of the AdEx
  Platform.
