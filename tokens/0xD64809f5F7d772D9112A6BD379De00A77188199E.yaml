  LSILVER provides the convenience and speed of digital asset trading, where traders can buy and sell
  from exchanges while providing the means to redeem tokens for physical silver bullion. Each LSILVER
  token will have an underlying asset of physical silver in our partner Custodian. LSILVER can be exchanged
  to Fiat according to physical silver price or even exchanged to physical silver bullion directly.


  LSILVER is is part of Lyfe program to create an asset-based stable token, backed-up by physical assets
  or commodities to complete market-based Lyfe Token ecosystem.


  LSILVER will introduce a new possibility and alternative of commodity trading using blockchain where
  real assets can be transferred in a decentralized distribution network. It will then improve the efficiency,
  transparency, and the cost of commodity trading.
