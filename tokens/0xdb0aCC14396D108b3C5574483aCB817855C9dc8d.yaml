description: >-
  Cryptocurrencies are "walled gardens" which cannot reuse, trigger, or execute transactions with other
  blockchains. If Alice wants to execute Bob’s smart contract, she can only send cryptocurrency from the
  blockchain on which Bob deployed the smart contract. This lack of cooperation stifles innovation and
  forces users to place unwarranted trust in validators or centralized exchanges. Merging blockchains
  together into Block Collider is like building roads between buildings. Hypothetically, one could build
  a building that has everything, but in practice some buildings are built to work in, some are built
  to live in — as long as citizens want to be in multiple buildings at different points in time, roads
  are valuable and necessary.


  A mineable multi-chain protocol for stable coins, decentralized exchanges, and meta contracts.


  A new macro-form of digital ownership, Emblems serve two very critical roles in the Block Collider’s
  operation.


  Emblems are only available during the ICO.


  The Block Collider is launching with five blockchains. On each of these blockchains we have deployed
  a “marked token” contract similar to colored coins. For example, “Marked Ethereum” is an Ethereum ERC20
  token. In order to distribute these easily in the ICO we are pegging a certain amount of the marked
  tokens on each chain to the Emblem. For instance if you owned 1 Emblem you would be able to redeem 3
  Marked NEO, 300 Marked Lisk, 1 Marked XCP, 3 Marked Waves, and 100 Marked Ethereum.


  After the ICO : Marked Tokens


  Once the ICO is complete and the Mainnet of the Block Collider goes online owners of Emblems can use
  their marked tokens as any regular token on each respective blockchain. The marked tokens are tracked
  by a special flag which cannot be changed and is a permanent part of the member blockchain.


  Owners of Emblems are free to use the marked tokens to conduct transactions and execute smart contracts
  that interact with the Block Collider. In the example above regular transactions are not picked up but
  the Marked Ethereum (M-ETH) transactions are picked up and added to the Block Collider blockchain.


  After the ICO : Emblems are for Miners


  Emblems after the sale are used by Miners to be able to earn more fees per block mined. If you own Emblems
  you can mine the Block Collider with the ability to add a bonus amount of transactions to each block
  you find based on how many Emblems you have. If you don’t plan on mining the block collider you can
  of course send the Emblems to someone else who does.
