  ITC is designed to solve the severe safety problems of present IoT. ITC applies a combination of asymmetric
  encryption of cryptography, semi-homomorphic-encryption ciphertext computing technology and distributed
  architecture without data center. Therefore, ITC can not only protect the users' devices from being
  attacked by hackers, ensuring its controlling right safety; but also defend users and their devices'
  data safety sovereignty and privacy security. For example, the data of intelligent device, such as the
  camera, can only be checked by users themselves.
