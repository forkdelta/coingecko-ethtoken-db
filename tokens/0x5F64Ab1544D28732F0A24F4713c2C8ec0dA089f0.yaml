description: >-
  DEXTF is a digital asset management infrastructure on blockchain that allows anyone to create, mint,
  and redeem XTF funds. At present, DEXTF supports more than 70 tokens and funds are soft-limited to 10
  tokens (this limit will be increased in next releases). The XTF fundsâ€™ ticker symbol and asset weights
  are determined by the fund manager when creating the fund. Each XTF fund is an ERC20 token with its
  own address and contract allowing users to hold, trade, transfer, redeem and utilize XTF fund like any
  other token. XTF funds are also composable, both downstream (as any ERC20 they can be used by other
  protocols as collateral or underlying for any DeFi application) and upstream (they can hold various
  other ERC20 like decentralized options, yield producing tokens, liquidity pools, etc.).
