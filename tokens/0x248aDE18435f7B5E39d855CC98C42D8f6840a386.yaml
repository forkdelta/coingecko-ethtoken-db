  Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the
  market. Moreover, there is the possibility that crypto will be floated on the Nasdaq, which would further
  add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. Some predict
  that all that crypto needs is a verified exchange traded fund (ETF). An ETF would definitely make it
  easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but there still needs to be the demand to want to invest in
