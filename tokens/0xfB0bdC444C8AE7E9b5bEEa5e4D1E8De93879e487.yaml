description: >-
  SpringRole is the platform where people can view, share and get attestations on their professional profile,
  thereby creating a verified resume that they can share and use. A userâ€™s professional profile contains
  three parts: educational qualifications, work experience and skillset.

  Each of these three will have their own flows to get attested and once they are verified, we write them
  to the blockchain. These claims, once verified, will not have to be re-verified in the future and can
  be relied upon.
