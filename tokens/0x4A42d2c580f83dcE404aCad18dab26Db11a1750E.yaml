  Relex is the world's first real estate development cryptocurrency. We have multiple development projects
  already running, such as Cocobay Danang and Marine City in Vietnam, and we are offering the world's
  first real estate pre-IPO blockchain offering before the fund lists on the New York Stock Exchange.
  For transparency, all of our contracts are posted on our website.


  Relex is a blockchain based funding vehicle creation of the parent company Squawk Advisors Inc. Squawk
  Advisors has an FDI development portfolio across multiple countries in the world. The Squawk group of
  companies has been contracting with FDI projects since 2014, and this Fall 2017, we are bringing our
  offerings onto the blockchain, such as Cocobay Danang, with its iconic tower seen here.


  Relex is the world's first cryptocurrency based real estate developer opportunity. RLX holders have
  the opportunity to invest in projects during the development phase, which results in exciting opportunities
  such as proxy ownership of resorts, shopping malls, offices, and more. And gain more rights as a proxy
  developer, having your voice heard regarding design and implementation of the final master plan.


  There is now a better way to access yield, while retaining your standards for high transparency and
  high accountability for your investable capital. Introducing Relex, the world's first real estate development
  focused cryptocurrency, designed to provide better and simplified access for investors to high-yield
  projects around the world, while qualifying real estate projects to a higher level of transparency in
  order to be eligible for institutional capital consideration. We support projects in both developed
  and developing markets that strive to set the bar higher in the interest of project integrity.


  According to Jones Lang Lasalle's Global Real Estate Transparency Index 2016, almost 75% of global capital
  invested in commercial real estate is in the Top 10 most transparent countries in the world. That means
  that projects in countries with low transparency scores are considered ineligible projects for investment.
  What if transparency scores in projects located in developing countries were improved, upgrading these
  projects and making them eligible for a wider stream of capital consideration? Relex is solving this
  problem by increasing transparency and accountability standards for real estate development projects
  in developing nations with low transparency scores, and aligns itself with projects that are committed
  to transparency, integrity, and accountability in their real estate projects. With Relex, the projects
  that we partner with agree to fund their development projects on the Relex blockchain, and agree to
  a more strict line of transparency and accountability standards.


  In turn, projects on the Relex blockchain get an increased transparency and accountability score, and
  become eligible for a wider stream of investable capital into their projects. This is a win-win situation
  for both the investor and the project owners, in which there is better capital access, and better access
  to real estate development projects with a high degree of yield.
