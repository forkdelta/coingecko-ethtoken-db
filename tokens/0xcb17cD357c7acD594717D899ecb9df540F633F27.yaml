description: >-
  CoinDeal Token is a project of CoinDeal exchange. CDL is a utility token based on the ETH blockchain
  (earlier on EOS) and will be tradable on multiple markets and pairs after the token distribution is
  completed on 12.11.2019.

  With CDL users can get lower trading fees, vote for new coins, access to additional trading features
  and later on access to the social trading platform, and more. Staking CDL Tokens in the CoinDeal wallet
  will allow decreasing trading fees to almost zero. Staking over 150.000 CDL will give a 0.0000% maker
  fee and a 0.0250% taker fee.
