The most striking feature of a masternode is its ability to help investors to acquire stable profits by virtue of simply locking up their holdings in the masternode for a fixed amount of time.\n\nWhile this may sound like a lucrative proposition, it should be clearly understood that hosting a masternode is out of reach for the average investor since it requires a substantial amount of financial capital and technical prowess.\n\nAPIS, also sometimes referred to as APIS Core, has been designed atop the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> public blockchain and serves as a masternode mediation platform that aims to help individual and corporate investors utilize their assets with desired masternodes easily and effectively.\nThe platform can be accessed via a host of digital mediums including PCs, laptops, and smartphones, allowing users to maximize their overall profits while on the move.","developer_score":13.101,"id":"apis","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4520/large/APIS_Logo_400_400.png?1550723752","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4520/small/APIS_Logo_400_400.png?1550723752","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4520/thumb/APIS_Logo_400_400.png?1550723752"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/apisplatform"],"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x4c0fbe1bb46612915e7967d2c3213cd4d87257ad","https://etherscan.io/token/0x4c0fbe1bb46612915e7967d2c3213cd4d87257ad","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x4c0fbe1bb46612915e7967d2c3213cd4d87257ad"],"chat_url":["https://t.me/Apisplatformkor","https://t.me/TheApisplatformJapan"],"homepage":["https://apisplatform.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Oxchild/crowdsale"]},"telegram_channel_identifier":"TheApisplatform"},"liquidity_score":14.845,"market_cap_rank":392,"name":"APIS","public_interest_score":42.602,"symbol":"apis","tickers":[{"base":"APIS","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"APIS","market":{"identifier":"bit_z","name":"Bit-Z"},"target":"ETH"}]}
