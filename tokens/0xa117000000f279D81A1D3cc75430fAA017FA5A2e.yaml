  Aragon is a decentralized app (dApp) on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  blockchain that allows anyone to create and manage a decentralized organization. The Aragon project
  is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights
  to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully
  decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that’s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an
  organization on the blockchain.


  In the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide
  direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve,
  scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon
  will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on
  all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors.
  It also doesn’t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don’t get it twisted,
  the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a “Best Underage
  European Programmer” award, and he’s a recipient of Forbes’ 30 under 30 recognition. He’s a young guy,
  but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission
  and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux
  distribution with face login.


  Aragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules
  for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token
  generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality
  of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies
  work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company
  or organization requires. It’s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned
  on and off, providing instant customization for the company’s needs. In addition, all of the code behind
  Aragon is open source. A company’s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company’s
  requirements.


  The modular design of Aragon doesn’t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies
  can edit existing modules, they’re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop
  atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon,
  combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that
  extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction.
  Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants
  to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn’t operate based on country boundaries. Instead,
  it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.


  The ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive
  structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold
  during Aragon’s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token
  has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals,
  participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit
  Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program.
