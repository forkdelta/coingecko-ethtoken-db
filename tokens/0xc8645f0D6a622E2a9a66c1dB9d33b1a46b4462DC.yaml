  The great idea behind the MykonosCoin (MYK ) is to combine blockchain with the services of Mykonos.
  As you can easily understand from the tokenâ€™s name, it is focused on the Greek island of Mykonos. Every
  year, the island welcomes more and more visitors and it is one of the most significant tourist attractions
  in Greece.
