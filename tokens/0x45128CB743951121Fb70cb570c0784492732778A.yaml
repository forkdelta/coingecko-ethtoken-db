  Fiat currency and Bitcoin have opposing monetary policies. Fiat is inflationary (money printing) and
  Bitcoin is deflationary (fixed supply and BTC is lost over time). But both are similar by the fact that
  they are backed by nothing. MetaWhale Gold ($MWG) has the same deflationary monetary policy of Bitcoin,
  but it actually has reserve assets of PAXG (gold!) to back it up. As the MWG supply deflates, the PAXG
  gold reserves keep increasing in size.


  MetaWhale Gold introduces the first truly sustainable Crypto Gold Standard.


  About:


  MetaWhale Gold is a new paradigm in elastic supply tokenomics. It employs a self-renewable deflationary
  monetary policy that’s backed by self-filling reserves of tokenized and redeemable physical gold. MetaWhale
  Gold integrates the category of Value MetaWhale as it establishes its value from its reserves of tokenized
  gold, an asset that has the longest track record as a reliable store of value.


  All around the cryptosphere are deflationary tokens, but market participants who enter after the implosion
  stage can only lose money as the systems collapse. Given that these protocols aren’t backed by anything
  other than their own tokens, the remaining holders get left with an important lesson about the true
  market value of their tokens. In MetaWhale Gold, deflation happens at the same time the protocol fills
  its own reserves. In doing so, the protocol allows all market participants to make the most out of a
  deflationary model whilst knowing to a deterministic certainty that their MetaWhale Gold holdings are
  backed by reserves of tokenized physical gold.
