To achieve this there is the so-called Rebase, which adjusts the supply to the demand.\n\nAll supply changes apply equally to every owner/wallet holing REB. Your balance changes but you always own the same % of the total supply. Your holdings increase in value as the market cap of REB grows.\n\nImagine yourself in a world where the ECB or FED prints some billions again and you receive \u201cnew\u201d money directly on your bank account. Sounds like a dream? Well not in crypto. Welcome to the world of Rebased.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"rebased","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12153/large/s8HYqb0Y_400x400.jpg?1597701085","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12153/small/s8HYqb0Y_400x400.jpg?1597701085","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12153/thumb/s8HYqb0Y_400x400.jpg?1597701085"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xE6279E1c65DD41b30bA3760DCaC3CD8bbb4420D6","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xE6279E1c65DD41b30bA3760DCaC3CD8bbb4420D6"],"homepage":["https://rebased.fi/"],"telegram_channel_identifier":"rebasedTG","twitter_screen_name":"Rebased_"},"liquidity_score":5.709,"market_cap_rank":null,"name":"Rebased","public_interest_score":0.001,"symbol":"reb","tickers":[]}
