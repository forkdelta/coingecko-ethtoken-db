description: >-
  The ETH Range Bound Min Volatility Set is for you if you believe the price of Ether will swing minimally
  in the medium term. This Set automatically rebalances cash (DAI) into ETH if the price of ETH dips more
  than 10% and ETH into cash (DAI) if the price of ETH rebounds more than 20%. The token tolerances are
  selected to enhance any crypto portfolio by buying dips and taking profits more frequently.
