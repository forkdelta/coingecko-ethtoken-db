  With the popularization of blockchain technology, a new form of crowdfunding for development, which
  you issue and reveal a cryptocurrency in a digital environment and sell it for a fiat currency or a
  cryptocurrency, has emerged. The scale of such crowdfunding is increasing rapidly, but because of the
  high difficulty of development, many teams are giving up or fleeing halfway, and thus the success rate
  is also lowered.


  PRESTO a token sale platform that provides the function to automatically generate smart contracts that
  extend the DAICO model, offering the investor protection that enforces the correct use of funds; it
  drastically reduces the costs of smart contracts, token development, and token sales, and helps development
  teams focus on service development.


  Furthermore, by introducing a token marketplace and a decentralized exchange (DEX), Presto will not
  just build the token sale platform but incubate new tokens and accelerate existing tokens to create
  a healthy and active token-sale ecosystem.
