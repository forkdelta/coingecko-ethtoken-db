description: >-
  A strictly-scarce Ethereum-based asset.

  Vether is designed to be a store-of-value with properties of strict scarcity, unforgeable costliness
  and a fixed emission schedule. Vether mimics characteristics of Bitcoin, where miners compete to expend
  capital to acquire newly-minted coins and chase ever-decreasing margins. Instead of expending capital,
  Vether participants compete to purchase it by destroying capital on-chain. As a result, all units of
  Vether are acquired at-cost and by anyone. This mechanism is called Proof-of-Value.
