description: >-
  StakeHound stETH is a wrapped token with a 1:1 representation of the userâ€™s underlying ETH. After a
  user onboards their ETH, StakeHound stakes those ETH for the users and redistributes the rewards to
  stETH. That way, the stETH allows you to receive ETH 2.0 staking rewards without the minimum staking
  requirement and no lock-up period as stETH can be sold at any time, for example, on Uniswap.
