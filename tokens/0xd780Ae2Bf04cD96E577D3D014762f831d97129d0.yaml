description: >-
  Envion has created the technology for the first truly mobile mining unit (MMU) that uses low-priced
  local energy to mine a broad spectrum of cryptocurrencies. By harvesting locally available clean energy
  right at the source, Envion can operate at a lower cost than competitors and at the same time reduce
  the CO2 footprint of the blockchain industry. Envion aims at decentralizing the highly-concentrated
  mining market and at bringing back control of the market to the users. Hence, profits generated by MMUs
  are 100% beneficial to token holders. Distribution of profit dividends will occur on a weekly basis:
  75% of profits will be emitted, while 25% will be used to reinvest directly in MMUs, in order to guarantee
  exponentially growing profits to the envion community.
