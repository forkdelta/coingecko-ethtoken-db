  Unifund is a decentralized mutual fund protocol running on the Ethereum blockchain;


  it allows users to pool their assets under the administration of a Fund Manager (any Ethereum address).


  The best part about our protocol is that it allows all this mutual fund business to be conducted in
  a trustless, decentralized manner which removes part of the risk from fund members and onto Fund Managers.
