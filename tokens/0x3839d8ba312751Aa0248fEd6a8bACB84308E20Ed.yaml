description: >-
  Bezop is a decentralized peer to peer e-commerce order management and processing system powered by smart
  contracts, an autonomous buyer-seller protection service and a simple vat collection system all built
  on a decentralized blockchain network. bezop aims to provide an open source and complete solution for
  running a successful ecommerce business online. Merchants can participate by selling products and services
  on their self-hosted e-commerce stores (the Bezop DOM) and broadcast orders to the network. The Bezop
  market runs on a blockchain with a native erc-20 protocol token (also called “bezop”), which miners
  earn on the ethereum blockchain by proof of work. Clients spend Bezop in purchasing goods and services
  on Bezop DOM and other integrated sites offering services and accepting payment in Bezops.
