  Woofy is blue dog companion token of YFI (Wifey)


  It utilizes a special Woof bonding curve which allows two-way conversion between the tokens. That means
  you can be exposed both to a lighthearted dog coin and the DeFi darling blue chip at the same time.


  Call woof to convert YFI into WOOFY.

  Call unwoof to convert WOOFY back to YFI.


  The ratio is always 1 YFI = 1,000,000 WOOFY. Woofy is always fully backed by YFI.
