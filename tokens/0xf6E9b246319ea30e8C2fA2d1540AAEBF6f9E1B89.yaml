description: >-
  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse Bitcoin Cash (BCH) through price feeds supplied by an oracle.


  The entry point is $218.33 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when
  it reaches its upper limit of $327.495 (i.e. when Inverse Bitcoin Cash's value reaches $109.165) or
  its lower limit of $109.165 (i.e. when Inverse Bitcoin Cashâ€™s value reaches $327.495). If it reaches
  either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange,
  but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either
  of its limits, it will be substituted for another iBCH with different limits.
