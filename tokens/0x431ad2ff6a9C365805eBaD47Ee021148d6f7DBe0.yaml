  dForce advocates for building an integrated and interoperable open finance protocol matrix, covering
  assets (multicurrency stablecoins, synthetic assets, USDx, GOLDx), lending (global liquidity pool) and
  trading (aggregator and AMM). dForce is currently deployed on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC).


  Our team includes both crypto veterans and professionals from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered Bank,
  CitiBank, Hony Capital. dForce is backed by investors including CMBI (China Merchants Bank International),
  Multicoin Capital and Huobi Capital (the investment arm of Huobi Group).


  We work with the world’s top-ranked security companies (Trail of Bits, Consensys Diligence, Certik,
  Quantstamp, Certora, PeckShield, SlowMist, SECBIT) on smart contract audits for all dForce native protocols.


  dForce Token (DF) is the governance token across dForce network, conferring holders the power to influence
  decisions concerning dForce protocols, including onboarding of new assets and collaterals, changes to
  risk parameters, fee accrual, interest alignment through voting process.


  Key Protocols:

  • dForce Lending & Synthetic Asset Protocol (https://app.dforce.network/), a pool-based general lending
  protocol which supports multisided transactions while featuring native over-collateralized stablecoins
  such as USX and EUX, essential cryptos such as xBTC and xETH, as well as synthetic assets that track
  stocks.

  • Yield Market (dToken) (https://markets.dforce.network/), the most accessible yield aggregator to farm
  the most attractive risk-adjusted yield across DeFi protocols. Instant withdrawal supported. • USDx
  (https://usdx.dforce.network/), the first decentralized and fiat-back stablecoin implementing systematic
  interest. 1 USDx = 80% USDC +10% PAX + 10% TUSD. USDx holders can earn interest by simply depositing
  USDx into the USR contract and can withdraw at any time.

  • GOLDx (https://goldx.dforce.network/), a gold token 100% backed by physical gold (through constituent
  gold token PAXG) and is denominated in gram. GOLDx is featured by 0 transaction fee and is 100% compatible
  with all DeFi protocols, making it easy for DeFi integrations.

  • dForce Trade (https://trade.dforce.network), aggregate proper liquidity and secure the best available
  price across multiple platforms to facilitate large-volume trades.
