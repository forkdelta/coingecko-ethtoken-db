description: "dForce advocates for building an integrated and interoperable open finance and monetary\
  \ protocol matrix, including asset protocols (USDx, GOLDx, dToken), liquidity protocol (dForce Trade),\
  \ and lending protocol (soon-to-be-launched dForce Lending).\ndForce Token (DF) is the utility token\
  \ that facilitates governance, risk buffers and interest alignment across the dForce Network.\nOur team\
  \ includes both crypto veterans and professionals from Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered Bank, Hony\
  \ Capital. dForce is backed by investors including CMBI (China Merchants Bank International), Multicoin\
  \ Capital and Huobi Capital (the investment arm of Huobi Group).\nKey Protocols:\n•\tUSDx (https://usdx.dforce.network/),\
  \ the first decentralized and fiat-back stablecoin implementing systematic interest. USDx holders can\
  \ earn interest by simply depositing USDx into the USR contract and can withdraw at any time.\n•\tGOLDx\
  \ (https://goldx.dforce.network/), a gold token 100% backed by physical gold (through constituent gold\
  \ token PAXG) and is denominated in gram. GOLDx is featured by 0 transaction fee and is 100% compatible\
  \ with all DeFi protocols, making it easy for DeFi integrations.\n•\tYield Market (dToken) (https://markets.dforce.network/),\
  \ the most accessible yield aggregator to farm the most attractive risk-adjusted yield across DeFi protocols\
  \ (the highest underlying yield in the market at present). Instant withdrawal supported.\n•\tdForce\
  \ Trade (https://trade.dforce.network), as an upgrade of dForce Swap, dForce Trade will scan for the\
  \ best possible price and aggregate proper liquidity across multiple platforms to facilitate large-volume\
  \ trades.\n•\tdForce Lending (coming soon), fully open and permission-less lending platform."
