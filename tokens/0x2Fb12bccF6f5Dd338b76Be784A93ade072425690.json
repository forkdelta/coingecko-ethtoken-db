The user can decide if he wants to become a Data Provider by sharing specific data based on a contractual agreement with future Data Consumers.\n\nThe Data Consumer only gets access to the data as agreed in the contract and for the sole purpose defined in the contract. In return, these Data Consumers - who are usually fitness providers like gyms and sports equipment manufacturers - will provide their products and services at a discounted rate, or even for free.","developer_score":19.043,"id":"beat","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4258/large/beat.png?1547039597","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4258/small/beat.png?1547039597","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4258/thumb/beat.png?1547039597"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/beattoken"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":2851951,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x2fb12bccf6f5dd338b76be784a93ade072425690","https://etherscan.io/token/0x2fb12bccf6f5dd338b76be784a93ade072425690","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x2fb12bccf6f5dd338b76be784a93ade072425690"],"chat_url":["https://discordapp.com/invite/PnyFgdX"],"facebook_username":"BeatToken","homepage":["https://beat.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/beat-its/smart-contracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/beattoken","telegram_channel_identifier":"beattoken","twitter_screen_name":"beattoken"},"liquidity_score":1.746,"market_cap_rank":675,"name":"BEAT","public_interest_score":39.613,"symbol":"beat","tickers":[{"base":"BEAT","market":{"identifier":"idex","name":"Idex"},"target":"ETH"}]}
