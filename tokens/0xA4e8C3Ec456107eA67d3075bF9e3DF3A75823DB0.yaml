  The Next-Generation Blockchain Application Platform for Ethereum.

  Loom Network’s DPoS sidechains allow for truly scalable blockchain games and DApps with the security
  of Ethereum mainnet. Like EOS on Ethereum.


  What is Loom Network?

  Loom Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that is live in production. It is a network
  of DPoS sidechains, which allows for highly-scalable games and user-facing DApps while still being backed
  by the security of Ethereum.

  Live in production

  Loom Network has been live in production since March 2018. Developers, start building on Loom today.


  Highly Scalable Sidechains

  Dubbed “EOS on Ethereum”, Loom’s DPoS sidechains provide the same high scalability and throughput promised
  by alternative platforms like EOS, while still being fully Ethereum-compatible and secure.


  Backed by Ethereum

  We built the world’s first Plasma Cash implementation, which allows Ethereum-based tokens to be used
  on Loom sidechains with the full security guarantees of Ethereum.
