description: >-
  XFai's lagship product, DEX Liquidity Oracle  (DLO),  leverages single-asset staking pools by dynamically
  providing liquidity to DEXs while synchronizing with current CEX liquidity. This generates returns,
  optimizes liquidity and unlocks utility for small and mid cap tokens. XFai develops tooling which empowers
  its tokenholders to make profits from the expected future volatility/high variance in the crypto markets.

  Led by a team of proven founders and backed by funding from world-class investors including LD Capital
  and AU21 and Digital Strategies, XFai aims to be the underlying architecture for liquidity and enabling
  price discovery for small and mid-cap tokens by giving them DeFi composability.
