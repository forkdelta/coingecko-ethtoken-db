  Dentacoin is an <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>-based blockchain
  platform regulated by smart contracts. The platform supports the dental community by building and creating
  solutions devoted to improving the quality of dental care worldwide. The blockchain gives Dentacoin
  the power to change the world for the better. Dentacoin develops the dental industry as well as creates
  market intelligence through a cryptocurrency reward system that inspires participation throughout the
  community.


  Dentacoin is the first cryptocurrency that uses a decentralized review platform and transparently rewards
  patients and dentists who make contributions that benefit the community. The Dentacoin Foundation team
  strongly believes in building a future healthcare industry that will fall into the hands of the people,
  resulting in the disruption of the existing industries and the creation of new industries in the short
  and long term.


  Dentacoin strives to create a dental industry community by rewarding people -who provide valuable contributions-
  with crypto currency. Through this reward system, the foundation will see a rise in a currency that
  will be able to reach a broad market, including a vast number of people who have yet to participate
  in any cryptocurrency economy.


  According to Harvard Business Review: “To protect the blockchain vision from political pressure and
  regulatory interference, blockchain networks rely on a decentralized infrastructure that can't be controlled
  by any one person or group." The integration of blockchain and dentistry is an extraordinary concept;
  one that requires the creation of a community in which transparency and shared responsibility can take
  place.


  Looking forward, Dentacoin expects the platform to drastically improve dental health and hygiene habits,
  thus improving the quality of life for individuals resulting in improved overall health and increased
  longevity.
