  Aelf is the versatile business blockchain platform powered by cloud computing and the central nervous
  system for businesses, transforming the way they deliver their services. By laying out the fundamental
  blockchain infrastructure, Aelf enables businesses to focus on building up their own dapps on their
  own chains with minimum effort. Acting as the master key, Aelf unlocks the potential for inter-business
  communication and collaboration using cross-chain efficiency. Incorporating modern technologies such
  as cloud nodes and parallel processing, Aelf is the blockchain system that achieves secure transactions
  at commercial scale.


  Aelf is one of the cryptocurrencies that is attracting crypto enthusiasts following its massive commercial
  adoption initiative. The coin seems to be leading on the technology front with higher blockchain efficiency,
  which is why it's also anticipated to be the Linux of Blockchains. aelf is an operating system for blockchains
  which can be customized by their respective users. Its cryptocurrency is denoted by the symbol ELF,
  with a total supply of 250 million ELF. It was launched on 21 December, 2017 on multiple exchanges in
  China without any ICO and instead got private investors on board. This ensured better compliance as
  KYC was done for all investors with most of them being accredited, with a good track record in token
  investment.


  Aelf was developed by Ma Haobao, who is also the CEO of Hoopox. The team is backed by a strong advisory
  board which includes Michael Arrington (CEO of TechCrunch and founding partner of FGB Capital). The
  team says it is working on unleashing the blockchain’s potential into mass applications and industries.
  aelf is now working with Innovation Alliance for increasing the acceptability of blockchain technology
  which will ultimately increase adoption of aelf’s blockchain. The team is focussed to develop aelf to
  improve other chains in the ecosystem by providing a template and infrastructure for interaction between
  the sidechains.


  Aelf also has a rewards system – Candy. With the Candy rewards system, you earn points, convertible
  for ELF, by accomplishing simple, daily tasks. Tasks include liking and replying to aelf tweets, inviting
  people to the Telegram channel, and other promotional activities. ELF are currently ERC20 tokens. As
  such, you can store them in any wallet with ERC20 support like MyEtherWallet or Exodus. The Ledger Nano
  S is also a great option if you’re interested in additional security.


  Aelf is a relatively new competitor in the dapp platform race but already has solid support from large
  investment capital firms. The project is utilizing resource separation through side chains and a unique
  governance model to build an entire blockchain operating system.
