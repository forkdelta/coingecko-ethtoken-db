description: >-
  Kyber’s on-chain liquidity protocol allows decentralized token swaps to be integrated into any application,
  enabling value exchange to be performed seamlessly between all parties in the ecosystem. Tapping on
  the protocol, developers can build payment flows and financial apps, including instant token swap services,
  erc20 payments, and innovative financial dapps - helping to build a world where any token is usable
  anywhere.


  Kyber Network maintains liquidity through the dynamic reserve pool. The pool contains all of the Reserve
  Entities in the system. Having multiple entities in the pool prevents monopolization and keeps exchange
  rates competitive. When a user requests an exchange, the Kyber smart contract makes the exchange through
  the Reserve Entity with the best exchange rate for the user. By allowing external Reserve Entities,
  Kyber Network prevents centralization and opens the door to low-volume token listings. External reserves
  may be fine with taking on the risk of storing less popular tokens that the Kyber reserves don’t list.

  To prevent bad actors in the reserve pool, Kyber Network has few safeguards. The network will flag any
  exchange rate for special approval that’s greatly outside the norm. To protect funds in a public reserve,
  Kyber makes all exchanges using them available through a transparent fund management model.


  The Kyber team is impressive. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loiluu/">Loi Luu</a>, Yaron Velner,
  and Victor Tran are the founders behind the project. Luu previously created Oyente, the first open-source
  security analyzer for <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> contracts,
  and cofounded SmartPool, a decentralized mining pool project. Velner has been active in the Ethereum
  bug bounty program, and Tran is also a lead developer at SmartPool. The team has a well-rounded advisory
  board with the most notable member being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitalik-buterin-267a7450">Vitalik
  Buterin</a>, Ethereum wunderkind. In August 2017, Kyber successfully launched their testnet beta. They
  plan on releasing their live product in Q1 this year in which you’ll be able to trade between Ethereum
  and ERC20 tokens. The project has an extensive list of partners including <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/request-network">Request
  Network</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/wax">Wax</a>, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/storm">Storm</a>.


  Because it’s an ERC20 token, you can store KNC in any wallet with ERC20 support. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/beginner-guide-to-myetherwallet-mewconnect">MyEtherWallet</a>
  is the most popular online option. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/complete-beginners-guide-to-metamask">MetaMask</a>
  works as well. Many investors choose to use a hardware wallet for additional security. You can’t go
  wrong with either the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/trezor-model-t-wallet-review">Trezor</a>
  or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ledger-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-review">Ledger</a> wallet
  as both supports KNC.
