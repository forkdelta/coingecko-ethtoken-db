description: >-
  Drops platform brings NFT staking and NFT loans, so that idle NFT assets can be put to work. By combining
  NFT fractionalisation, trustless loans and LP tokens, users on Drops platform can extract additional
  value from their NFTs.

  It’s possible through the creation of a new NFT product “Margin NFT”. Whitelisted NFT can be turned
  into a Margin NFT and used within Drops ecosystem.
