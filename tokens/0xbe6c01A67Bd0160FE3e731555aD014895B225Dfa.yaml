  COMBINING CRYPTO & PROPERTY

  Real Estate property that is mortgage-free becomes profitable for both the owners and the holders of
  the FND  Stable coins. Tokenizing new property adds a new financing model and disrupts the current mortgage
  system ruled by banks.


  Rental income rights are sold using FND STABLE COINS. Holders of the FND Stable Coins will earn a residual
  monthly return paid in FND Tokens.


  As an investor, you purchase either or both the FND Stable Coin connected to one or more Real Estate
  Properties and/or the FND Token we use as a payout for the rents.


  By holding a certain amount of FND Stable Coins you purchase the right to receive the percentage of
  the rent that corresponds to the amount of Stable Coins in your wallet.


  Residual income for as long as you hold the Stable Coins
