  The Blocktix System is a platform that replaces the current fragmented markets of event ticket distribution,
  ticket transfer and event promotion. Blocktix is a single system for all services and provides a low
  overhead for distributors and promoters, freeing up money otherwise wasted in inefficient market based
  systems.
