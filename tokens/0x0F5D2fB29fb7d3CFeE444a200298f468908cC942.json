In this virtual world, you purchase plots of land that you can later traverse, build upon, and monetize. There\u2019s no limit to what you can do. It\u2019s the first digital platform that\u2019s completely owned by its users. Similar to games like Skyrim and Fallout, Decentraland is an all-immersive virtual universe. However, instead of playing on a 2-dimensional screen, you participate in a 3-dimensional world. It seems to be the logical next step before creating full-blown AI-based games in the physical space \u00e0 la Westworld. Similar groupings on LAND comprise Districts. Districts are basically communities that revolve around a shared theme. For example, there may be a District just for crypto enthusiasts with cryptocurrency apps and services.\n\nThe Decentraland team is led by Ari Meilich (Project Lead) and Esteban Ordano (Tech Lead). Ordano previously worked at <a href=\"https://bitpay.com/\">Bitpay</a> as a software engineer and founded Smart Contract Solutions, Inc. Both founders have also worked together in creating Stremium and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcore\">Bitcore</a>. Decentraland has been around for longer than you may think. The team hit their first development milestone, Stone Age, in June 2015. This was a simple, pixelated grid that allocated pixels to users through a proof-of-work algorithm. Most recently, they held a Terraform Event in which they sold LAND in the new, 3D world. The team has also partnered with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/district0x\">district0x</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aragon\">Aragon</a>, and imToken to provide some of their services.\n\nMANA is the token used to buy lands in Decentraland. The Blockchain platform can be incorporated in order to buy or sell the various digital assets available in the virtual world. An unclaimed land would have the same market pricing on every exchange possible and precisely the developers are on a hunt for such since as they can build on top of it, and attract lot of popularity. However, one must keep in mind that the land parcels are different from them and each one of them varies according to the various market conditions of that time. Mana can be a great investment and can be bought by trading and with other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, or any other prominent cryptocurrency and on some of the most notable cryptocurrency exchanges. Specifically, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/huobi\">Huobi</a> are two of the best cryptocurrency exchanges that one can suggest for trading Mana tokens.\n\nThe Decentraland coin isn\u2019t a minable cryptocurrency as it is issued on the Ethereum blockchain, unlike Bitcoin and other similar currencies. So users looking to engage in some Decentraland mining will be disappointed. Instead, it was sold during token sales and is now being traded on exchanges.","developer_score":59.067,"id":"decentraland","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/878/large/decentraland-mana.png?1550108745","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/878/small/decentraland-mana.png?1550108745","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/878/thumb/decentraland-mana.png?1550108745"},"links":{"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":1968414,"blockchain_site":["https://enjinx.io/eth/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","https://etherscan.io/token/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x0f5d2fb29fb7d3cfee444a200298f468908cc942"],"homepage":["https://decentraland.org/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/decentraland/cli","https://github.com/decentraland/decentraland-dapps","https://github.com/decentraland/land-auction","https://github.com/decentraland/mana","https://github.com/decentraland/marketplace"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/decentraland","twitter_screen_name":"decentraland"},"liquidity_score":50.113,"market_cap_rank":84,"name":"Decentraland","public_interest_score":26.771,"symbol":"mana","tickers":[{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"altilly","name":"Altilly"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bibox","name":"Bibox"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MNA","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MNA","market":{"identifier":"bitfinex","name":"Bitfinex"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bitrue","name":"Bitrue"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bitrue","name":"Bitrue"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bitrue","name":"Bitrue"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"bitrue","name":"Bitrue"},"target":"XRP"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"catex","name":"Catex"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"dextrade","name":"Dex-Trade"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"hitbtc","name":"HitBTC"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"livecoin","name":"Livecoin"},"target":"ETH"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"USDT"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"upbit","name":"Upbit"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"upbit_indonesia","name":"Upbit Indonesia "},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"QC"},{"base":"MANA","market":{"identifier":"zb","name":"ZB"},"target":"USDT"}]}
