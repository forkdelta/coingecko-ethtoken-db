  P2PS Purpose:

  The purpose of our ICO is to bring to you a secure system through which you can exchange confidential
  digital assets or files with absolutely no interference from any third party; not even a network or
  systems administrator

  What Can P2PS Do That Others Donâ€™t?

  P2PS is a pure peer-to-peer platform which safeguards, for example, your medical records, banking information
  and other sensitive digital assets, during exchange between two parties. Such platforms today are simply
  nonexistent.
