description: >-
  BondAppétit is the first and the only DeFi protocol (as of April 2021) with a stablecoin fully backed
  by real-world assets with fixed periodic income. Businesses can borrow money (in fiat as well as in
  crypto) from the protocol, providing bonds as collateral. BondAppétit is a part of the Ethereum DeFi
  ecosystem.



  The price of the BondAppétit native stablecoin (USDap) equals $1 at all times. The token is issued only
  if the protocol has sufficient collateral.
