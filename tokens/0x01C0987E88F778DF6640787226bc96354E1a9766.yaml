description: "The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the UAT platform (UAT) is\
  \ a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the UAT platform,\
  \ designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the UAT platform, and intended\
  \ to be used solely as the primary utility token on the platform. \n\nThe UAT issued and sold in connection\
  \ with the token sale are being created as ERC20 compliant tokens on the Ethereum protocol.\n\nUAT is\
  \ a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the payment medium of service exchange\
  \ between participants on the UAT platform. The goal of introducing UAT is to provide a convenient and\
  \ secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the\
  \ UAT platform. UAT does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or\
  \ interest in the Foundation, the Distributor, its affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking,\
  \ nor will UAT entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment\
  \ returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in Singapore or any relevant jurisdiction.\
  \ UAT may only be utilised on the UAT platform, and ownership of UAT carries no rights, express or implied,\
  \ other than the right to use UAT as a means to enable usage of and interaction within the UAT platform.\n\
  \n UAT provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to participate\
  \ in the ecosystem on the UAT platform. UAT is an integral and indispensable part of the UAT platform,\
  \ because without UAT, there would be no incentive for users to participate in activities on the UAT\
  \ platform. Users of the UAT platform and/or holders of UAT which did not actively participate will\
  \ not receive any UAT incentives.\n\nThe limit of 500 million UAT is strictly imposed without any further\
  \ increase.\n\n UAT are designed to be consumed/utilised, and that is the goal of the UAT token sale."
