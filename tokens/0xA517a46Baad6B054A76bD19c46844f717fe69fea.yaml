  CarbCoin is an experiment designed to combine the best features of cryptocurrencies and the environmental
  healing solutions to fundamentally change the way that people handle with waste.


  CarbCoin presents great opportunities for those who may have a great value on the waste management market
  but just canâ€™t catch those values in because of the way such systems are currently designed!
