  Polymath simplifies the legal process of creating and selling security tokens. It makes a new token
  standard, the ST20, and enforces government compliance. Only a “list of authorized investors and their
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> wallet addresses” can hold ST20 tokens.
  Therefore, token issuers don’t need to worry about the legal implications of your security falling into
  the wrong hands. In order to launch a legally compliant token, the Polymath platform brings together
  issuers, legal delegates, smart contract developers, KYC verification, and a decentralized exchange.
  All transactions on the Polymath platform take place using the native POLY token.


  Polymath has programmable equity. Polymath enables companies to take control of their equity issuance
  through programmable code. It is raising in cryptocurrency opens up an entire wealth of new investors.
  Polymath eliminates the middleman and financial structures that hinder the deployment of equity. There
  is a trove of wealth that is untouched by Wall Street that can now be accessed through Polymath.


  In 2017, Polymath raised over $1.2 billion in funding by selling utility tokens and security tokens.
  Utility tokens, such as <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/waltonchain">Waltonchain</a>, give
  you access to a token’s network and are far more common than security tokens. Security tokens, however,
  provide equity or a claim to dividends from a company. As a result, security tokens, like any securities,
  are subject to government regulation. Polymath’s new standard for blockchain security tokens aims to
  embed the necessary regulatory requirements into smart contracts and comply entirely with government
  security regulations.


  A wide array of security tokens that will be listed on Polymath at some point will require investors
  to be accredited, or to be from specific countries.
