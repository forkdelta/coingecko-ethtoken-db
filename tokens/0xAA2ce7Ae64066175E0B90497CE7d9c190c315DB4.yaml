  What is Suterusu (Suter)?

  Suterusu is a project built upon the state-of-the-art cryptographic technologies zk-Consnark. Suterusu
  project CTO Dr. Huang Lin partners with cryptographers from Centre national de la recherche scientifique
  and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology co-authored a paper on a new efficient range proof scheme with
  transparent setup (accepted by a top Cryptography conference Eurocrypt 2021), which serves as the foundation
  of Suterusu protocol. Suterusu protocol can provide privacy protection for the users’ transaction data
  without comprising efficiency.


  To date, Suterusu network has 47 node operators and over 158k mining participates, collectively over
  80% staking rate. With 3,000 Suter token reward per 60s, the network generated over 2bn suter token
  rewards since launch which bring the total circulating supply to 3.7bn suter token. Private round investor’s
  token have been fully unlocked since Jan 2021, and the foundation’s token will be unlocked by the end
  of 2022.


  What is Suter Shield?

  Suter Shield is a decentralized, layer-2 solution for transaction and data-protection built on Ethereum,
  while also can be integrated with other layer-1 projects supporting smart contracts such as Binance
  Smart Chain, Heco etc.


  It applies public key homomorphic encryption to protect the transactional amount and conceals the identities
  of the sender and receiver of a transaction among other system users through invoking zero-knowledge
  proof. In other words, Suterusu protocol not only provides anonymity for the involved parties and but
  also transactional confidentiality.


  Suter Shield allows the sender of a transaction to arbitrarily select the target receiver of a confidential
  transaction without the need of sharing any secret with the receiver beforehand. Therefore, it is not
  only much more user-friendly, but it also provides a foundation to adapt to more sophisticated privacy-preserving
  DeFi functionalities such as DEX, insurance, loan, etc.


  In addition, compared with other similar solution, Suter Shield not only facilitates the anonymous and
  confidential transactions of ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but it is also a much more modularized and universal
  privacy-protection solution for any smart-contract platforms, which is why we can easily transform our
  solutions to other platforms such as BSC or HECO. Furthermore, the Suter VM not only provides anonymous
  payment functionality for smart contract platforms but also anonymous BTC cross-chain functionality
  that will bring more liquidity to the Suter ecosystem.


  Suterusu’s vision to provide privacy-protection for the users of all digital assets, therefore, Suterusu
  takes regulation compliance to its heart at the beginning of the system design. We apply blacklist and
  recursive blacklisting to ensure our system is regulation compliant. Any Suter transfer operation is
  required to compare the sender accounts of a transaction to the blacklist accounts. A transaction that
  involves any blacklist account will be rejected. This will guarantee the Suterusu ecosystem will effectively
  eradicate any misbehavior that is against the financial regulation, such as money launder.


  Suter token is native governance and utility token. It’s a fixed-supply ERC-20 token that is used for
  the purpose of community growth and rewards for the users participating in the Suter DAO voting.
