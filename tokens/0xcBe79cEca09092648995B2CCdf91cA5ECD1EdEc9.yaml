  BTCSHORT seeks to provide the inverse return of Bitcoin for a single day through the use of short sales.
  Our smart contract is integrated with industry-leading lending facilities and execution providers. When
  depositing stablecoin to our smart contract, we go out and initiate loans at the most competitive rates
  and sell at the best price. Users can buy this token as a hedging mechanism or as a means of protection
  against declining Bitcoin prices.
