description: >-
  NAGA is a public listed, EU-regulated German Fintech company with trading-platforms for financial markets
  and virtual goods, a market cap of more than 200m Euros, millions in revenues and billions in trading
  volume every month. Investments and trading are ruled and governed by greedy banks and corporates that
  control access, operate non-transparent and always take a cut of your money. At NAGA we are about to
  change that. By introducing the NAGA COIN, we are on a mission to revolutionize the outdated banking
  sector. The financial markets are about to change, and we embrace that.
