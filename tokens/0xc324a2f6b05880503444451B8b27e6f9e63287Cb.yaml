  Exchange Union is a “decentralized network” that connects individual digital asset exchanges from around
  the world. The team is on a mission to solve one of crypto’s most prominent issues – illiquidity. Most
  investors have experienced this first-hand: You find a digital asset you like and want to invest in.
  However, the coin is only available on a handful of exchanges. On top of that, you can only use <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a>
  or <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a> to trade for it. This leads to
  a sometimes hour-long process filled with multiple manual transfers over at least two exchanges.


  Payment channels provide an instant way to transfer digital assets off-chain between two parties. The
  transactions are only recorded on the blockchain when the payment channel is first opened and when it’s
  closed. You can think of it as updating balances on both ends of the channel for each transfer. Once
  you close the payment channel, both parties get their respective final balances. Payment channels are
  trustless – any disputes are resolved automatically through cryptography. And, transfers using them
  are secured by the underlying blockchain making them as reliable as exchanges on the blockchain itself.
  Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and Ethereum’s <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/raiden-network">Raiden
  Network</a> are two of the most popular examples of payment channels.


  James Wo (CEO), Terry Culver (CSO), Mikael Wang (Chief Blockchain Architect), and Kilian Rausch (Product
  Director) lead the Exchange Union management team. The team has extensive blockchain experience with
  some impressive positions on their resumes. Wo is the Founder and Chairman of the Board of Digital Finance
  Group – the world’s leading blockchain focused business group. Wang was formally the CTO of BTCC as
  well as a Chief Solutions Architect at Ericsson. Rausch was previously the PO at Mobi, a leading digital
  asset wallet.
