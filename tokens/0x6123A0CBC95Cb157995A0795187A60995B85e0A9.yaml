description: >-
  The BTC High Volatility Set is for you if you believe the price of Bitcoin will swing within a large
  range in the medium to long term. This Set automatically allocates cash (DAI) into BTC if the price
  of BTC dips more than 40% and BTC into cash (DAI) if the price of BTC rebounds more than 30%. The token
  tolerances are selected to balance profit against risk, preventing token holders from selling into a
  rally (or buying into a drop) yet still taking profits when the downside of missing a trade is too high.
