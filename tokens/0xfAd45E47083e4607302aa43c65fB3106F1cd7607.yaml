  What is HOGE?

  HOGE, formerly known as Hoge.Finance or Hogecoin, describes itself as a community-driven DeFi auto-staking
  ERC-20 token with a capped and deflationary supply. HOGE was fair-launched on February 7, 2021 with
  no tokens allocated to the team. Initial HOGE supply was 1,000,000,000,000 with half (500 billion) permanently
  burned at launch.


  Deflationary Cryptocurrency

  A 2% tax is levied on every HOGE transaction that takes place. 1% of that tax is sent to the burn wallet
  and permanently removed from the supply. The other 1% is redistributed to all wallets holding HOGE outside
  of exchanges.


  HOGE launched with the intention of simply being a deflationary “Doge but DeFi”. However, a team of
  HOGE founders with a larger vision stewarded the project toward a more philanthropic and utilitarian
  roadmap.


  HOGE is one of the first DeFi memecoins to successfully complete a Certik audit. No critical, major,
  or medium findings were found. As of this writing the skynet security score is 90. https://www.certik.org/projects/hogefinance


  HOGE has begun minting NFT's for holders as well as sponsoring eSports and Rally Racing Trucks.


  In May a Swiss verein non-profit DAO hybrid was created to enact community approved actions for the
  token also to sign contracts and business agreements going forward with Centralized Exchange’s. HOGE
  has implemented a non-profit partnership initiative including a Twitter campaign called #HogeSavesTheAnimals
  through which the community nominates charitable causes for HOGE to support. Under this and related
  initiatives HOGE has raised over $20,000 for animals. The HOGE team looks to it’s HogeGameLabs to explore
  dApp games development later in 2021.
