description: >-
  UniMex is an innovative onchain margin-trading platform entirely contained within Uniswap. Which means
  that shorts/longs are directly executed on Uniswap, rather than through an offchain approach e.g. through
  a 0x relayer. Margin traders are charged fees which are disbursed to lenders as a reward for supplying
  liquidity to lending pools.
