  Lunyr (pronounced Lunar), however, is one of the most unique implementations of blockchain yet, aiming
  to be a decentralized, and peer-to-peer knowledge database, aka the “Blockchain-based Wikipedia”. It
  strives to be the most innovative and comprehensive source of knowledge in domains like crypto projects,
  technology, finance, law, investment, and more, on the web.


  The cofounders of Lunyr are Arnold Pham, Andrew Tran, and Christopher Smith. The Lunyr ICO ended on
  26th April 2017, with around USD 0.3 million in capital being generated. The open beta was then launched
  on 30th January 2018. It is based on the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">Ethereum</a>
  network. The reward system which enables writers to earn rewards for authoring articles was also launched
  at the same time, allowing writers to earn LUN coins in exchange for quality pieces. Initially, Lunyr
  will mostly focus on the world of cryptocurrencies and related domains, with emphasis on up and coming
  projects. After an active and dedicated community of readers and writers is developed, Lunyr will branch
  into other areas such as science and technology, investment, finance, etc.


  Lunyr is unique in its vision, and usage of the blockchain technology in order to provide a comprehensive,
  decentralised, crowdsource, and peer-reviewed vault of knowledge, open and free to everyone. Lunyr aims
  to not only be a knowledge encyclopedia for the web, but also intends to enhance the blockchain technology
  by giving DApps (Decentralised Applications) the ability to tap into the knowledge base and access real-time
  data. This innovative feature can be used in applications ranging from Virtual Reality to Artificial
  Intelligence. The decentralised and peer-to-peer nature of Lunyr allows all content on the knowledge-base
  to be free from manipulation, and censorship. Since all submissions are peer-reviewed by the community,
  the chances of incorrect or dubious data making its way onto the encyclopedia are very low.
