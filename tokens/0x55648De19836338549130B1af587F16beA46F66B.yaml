description: >-
  Publica aims to bring the publishing economy into the blockchain revolution. Publica's platform will
  host book crowdfunding, online marketplaces (ecommerce), apps, ereaders and ewriters doing double-duty
  as digital wallets. READ tokens represent books you own so they’re property backed by the blockchain.
  Smart contracts and RIGHT tokens will back the automated performance of agreements like derivative rights
  for movies, games, sequels etc. Publica’s ecosystem is the multi-sided economy of publishing including
  service-providers like illustrators, editors, marketers, retailers etc., so they can benefit from the
  platform’s network effects.
