description: >-
  A keep is an off-chain container for private data. Keeps help contracts harness the full power of the
  public blockchain — enabling deep interactivity with private data.


  Keep Network aims to provide an off-chain “containers” — called keeps — that should keep private data
  safe from the public blockchain, thereby enabling smart contracts to maximize the full potential of
  blockchain tech without compromising on transparency or privacy. Keeps will be used to encrypt and store
  private data, and the keeps are to be protected by secure multi-party computation (sMPC) that allows
  generating, storing, encrypting and transmitting of data among different users.
