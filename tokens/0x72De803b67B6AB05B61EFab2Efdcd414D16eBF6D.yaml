  LedgerScore is credit reporting for cryptocurrency. Unlike traditional credit reporting bureaus, like
  Equifax, LedgerScore aggregates its data from cryptocurrency transactions.


  LedgerScore provides users with complete data on cryptocurrency transactions and comprehensive and credible
  credit scores with patent-pending technology. By creating a new golden standard, LedgerScore is aiming
  to bridge the gap between centralized (CeFi) and decentralized (DeFi) worlds, while complementing traditional
  credit score.


  We serve as both ""hub"" and ""bridge"" between modern and traditional financial ecosystems. Users will
  be able to see both traditional financial and crypto scores in one place, so no compromises are necessary.
