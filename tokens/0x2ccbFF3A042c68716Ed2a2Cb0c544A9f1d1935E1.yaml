  DMarket is a decentralized game asset marketplace. The marketplace covers a wide variety of games and
  turns virtual items into real commodities that can be traded on the blockchain.


  The idea of tokenization is central to the blockchain where any item can be represented as a token on
  the blockchain. This creates an emerging economy around digital assets where they become real items.
  There are an estimated 2.3 billion gamers worldwide and ample opportunity to monetize digital assets.
  The gaming economy is estimated at $450 billion


  There are two types of assets available on DMarket. The first type is a virtual Steam item. This Steam
  item is an in-game asset this is available for a specific game. At the moment there is a horde of items
  available for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. There is also a DMarket Blockchain item that is an internal
  blockchain item that can be traded on the DMarket blockchain.


  Users can sell Steam items for US Dollars (USD) or DMarket items for USD or DMC, the internal DMarket
  cryptocurrency. Users can buy Steam items for USD or DMC or DMarket items for DMC. In order to sell
  Steam items on DMarket, users have to connect their Steam account to their DMarket account. DMarket
  blockchain items can be traded without connecting to Steam. Users have to register on DMarket. This
  creates a DMC wallet for them where they can store their DMC currency and DMarket items. The DMarket
  platform also has its own block explorer. All wallets and transactions are recorded in the public blockchain.


  DMarket has a future-proof use case as the demand for a universal gaming trading platform is imminent.
  Strategic partnerships between game title developers, the gaming community and gamers will ensure that
  DMarket lives well beyond its proprietary blockchain phase.
