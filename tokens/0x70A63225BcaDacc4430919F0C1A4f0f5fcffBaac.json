Taking online surveys will become a fair exchange, where survey creators and participants hold significantly more power than third parties. Microscopic fees, on a per-survey basis, will put more earnings into the hands of survey takers.\n\nThe role of our platform, in its simplest form, is to match people with the most profitable surveys available to them. Creators will have complete control over who takes their survey, and how much it pays. On the flip side, participants will have complete ownership over their earnings. This is in stark contrast to the current model.","developer_score":12.0,"id":"vey","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7282/large/dkDh4z0a_400x400.jpg?1547043914","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7282/small/dkDh4z0a_400x400.jpg?1547043914","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/7282/thumb/dkDh4z0a_400x400.jpg?1547043914"},"links":{"announcement_url":["https://medium.com/vey-io"],"bitcointalk_thread_identifier":5058101,"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x70a63225bcadacc4430919f0c1a4f0f5fcffbaac"],"homepage":["https://vey.io/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/Mandil/surveyapp"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/vey_io/","telegram_channel_identifier":"Vey_io","twitter_screen_name":"Vey_io"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":4866,"name":"VEY","public_interest_score":28.263,"symbol":"vey","tickers":[{"base":"VEY","market":{"identifier":"stocks_exchange","name":"STEX"},"target":"BTC"}]}
