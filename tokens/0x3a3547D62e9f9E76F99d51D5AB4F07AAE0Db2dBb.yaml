description: >-
  Bitica Coin(bitica), created in 2018, was the first pos/pow base cryptocurrency created in Estonia (the
  first country to legalise Cryptocurreny). Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These
  are frequently called bit coins, as a blend of BDCC coin alternative. BDCC and its derivatives use decentralized
  control as opposed to centralized electronic money/central banking systems. The decentralized control
  is related to the use of bitcoin's blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed.


  At Bitica, we believe in financial freedom and economic independence, which is possible through BDCC
  coin.
