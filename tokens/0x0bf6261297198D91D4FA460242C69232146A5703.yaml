  Libera allows users or entities to create their own decentralized crypto custodies, which can be adopted
  by any DEX, CEX or DeFi application. Hodlers of the assets can be elected from the top users of the
  exchange, or from ones who contributed to its growth. Each custody is connected only to a particular
  trading platform (CEX, DEX or Dapp), but the platform itself can use several custodies for the same
  asset.
