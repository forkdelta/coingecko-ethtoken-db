description: >-
  Float Protocol is building the decentralised monetary system of the future. At the heart of the protocol
  is the FLOAT token. It is designed to be the first truly native internet currency and fully satisfying
  all three of major properties of money: as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account.


  Unlike most stablecoins, whilst FLOAT is designed to be stable and have significantly lower volatility
  than most cryptocurrencies, it is not designed to hold its price at $1.00. Instead, like most major
  fiat currencies, it is designed to float and change value over time.


  FLOAT is stabilised through frequent auctions to expand or contract the supply. It is also partly supported
  by a 'Basket of cryptocurrencies that are used as part of the auction process.
