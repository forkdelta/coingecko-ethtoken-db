Analyzing the color of pictures on particular applications and ranking the colored part of each picture by percentage, we can get a unique color code for each picture, which means the color parameter. Besides, we have designed a set of algorithms for this process. Thus we can set up the color parameter, time bound and author signature to protect the rights of original inventors. The rights of all works can be employed and traced by intelligent contracts.\n\nColor parameter:\nSample=xlnRed+ylnYellow+zlnBlue\nAmong them, x, y, z respectively represents the proportion of the three colors that occupying the highest proportion in a certain picture.
