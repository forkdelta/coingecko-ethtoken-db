description: >-
  Trism is a collectables creator and distributor of original digital art supported by it’s own native
  token ‘trism’. Trism tokens can be used to buy and sell NFT’s from the trism collectables series. NFT
  art assets are available on opensea and rarible. In the future, trism may offer NFT’s with financial
  components that enable the project to generate sustainable and predictable recurring revenue. Any recurring
  revenue generated by the project will be re-distributed to holders via staking of Univ2 LP’s in a farm
  (Currently targeting Unicrypt as host) through the re-purchase and redistribution of trism tokens in
  market.
