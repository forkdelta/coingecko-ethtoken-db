description: >-
  FART is built to capture the majority of ETH upside while reducing ETH exposure in times of uncertainty.
  Instead of experiencing 100% of price movement (both up and down), at the best of times FART may maintain
  up to 90% ETH allocation, and at the worst of times FART may maintain only 10% ETH allocation.
