  Our foundation started at using an ERC-20 tokens, Some of the utilities include Discounted trading fees
  and Access to specialised services launched on the Centralex platform additional features worth mentioning
  are our Staking and Governance mechanisms as well as our unique Cen-Split Rewards program.


  Custo-DeFi: Custo-DeFi is a new concept created by our Centralex team. The name says it already, Custodial
  DeFi. How does this work? You have Centralized exchanges who are a custodial service where you store
  all your assets and private keys. If you want to stake, governance or join any other DeFi solution you
  need to transfer your funds to a DeFi (Web3) wallet. When we talk about a DEX we know that you are 100%
  in control over your own wallets and funds and are able to do P2P transactions. We are Centralex put
  both CEX and DEX into one platform called Custo-DeFi. This allows you as a user to use the full custodial
  safety from a CEX but have the freedom of a DEX. This allows you to stake, governance, and participate
  in any other DeFi soliution on the market including trading on UniSwap or any other decentralized exchange.
  This all thanks to our partner Fireblocks.com who is providing us Centralex the best wallet technology
  in the industry with their Multi sig MPC wallet technology. Centralex will NEVER store your private
  keys on any of our servers.


  The CenX token is a deflationary token, and much like the staking rewards will follow a yearly â€œhalving
  burn rate. Every transaction where CenX is used on the Centralex exchange for transactional fees will
  result in a specific percentage of the token supply being burned. The burn will start at 5% and will
  halve each year thereafter. This decreases the total supply of CenX, thus increasing the scarcity of
  each token and our burn schedule looks as followed. First-year 5%, second year 2.5% and every year after
  this will be halved.
