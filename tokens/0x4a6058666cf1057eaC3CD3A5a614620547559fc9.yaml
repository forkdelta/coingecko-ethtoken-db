  Brickblock is not just an idea or a whitepaper. It is one of the only blockchain projects with a working
  product backed by technical and legal proofs of concept. In the coming weeks, Brickblock will offer
  the world’s first tokenized real estate asset on the blockchain. Brickblock’s final ICO period will
  be the last public sale of Brickblock tokens (BBK). BBK can be traded on exchanges or activated. BBK
  holders who have activated their tokens profit from every transaction on Brickblock.
