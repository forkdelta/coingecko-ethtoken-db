  What Is SparkPoint (SRK)?


  SparkPoint or officially, SparkPoint Technologies Inc., is a duly registered corporation in the Philippines
  under the SEC. The project was launched on October 5, 2018 and is one of the pioneer cryptocurrency
  startups in the Philippines. The project aims to fast track mainstream adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency
  through an ecosystem of practical products and services.


  SparkPoint started with an initial funding of $50,000. With only this minimal capital combined with
  discipline, determination, and hard work, the team was able to launch various blockchain-based products
  and services including SparkPoint Wallet, SparkLearn, SparkPlay, SparkEarn, and SparkDeFi. These products
  and services have collectively reached hundreds of thousands of users and are steadily growing.


  The SparkPoint Ecosystem is composed of:


  SparkPoint Wallet


  Non-custodial mobile cryptocurrency wallet that natively supports various cryptocurrencies including
  SparkPoint (SRK), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and other ERC-20 tokens. It also
  offers built-in Decentralized Exchanges including Uniswap, ChangeNOW, and Changelly. A virtual currency
  exchange (VCE) license application is ongoing to legally enable fiat integration in the SparkPoint Wallet.


  SparkLearn


  E-learning platform focused on educational content about blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, and
  financial literacy. The platform currently offers free courses for these topics and is continuously
  being improved through UI/UX enhancements, onboarding of new mentors, and integrating a Learn-to-Earn
  model. Education is at the heart of SparkPoint.


  SparkPlay


  Collection of mobile casual games with cryptocurrency as central theme. Currently available games include
  Crypto Slicer, Crypto Burst, and Crypto Shooter. Tournaments and achievement bounties are being conducted
  regularly as part of SparkPlay’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming model. P2E is an emerging paradigm in gaming
  where a significant chunk of value goes to players. Using blockchain technology, players are empowered
  to truly own game items and earn cryptocurrency rewards.


  SparkEarn


  SparkPoint referral and rewards program where users can earn SRK and other tokens from sponsors by performing
  simple bounties. SparkEarn accounts are also currently being used as a single sign-on (SSO) account
  for SparkLearn and future SparkPoint services including SparkPlay and SparkDeFi.


  SparkDeFi


  A governance token-based platform that empowers individuals to unlock the true value of their cryptocurrency
  assets. SparkDeFi offers an AMM Decentralized Exchange, Liquidity and Pool-Based Staking, P2P Lending
  and Borrowing, and DeFi Assets Protocols Management in a seamless, transparent, secure, inclusive, and
  interoperable approach.


  Features of SparkDeFi that are already available include:


  - Liquidity Staking

  - Pool-Based Staking

  - SparkBridge for bridging ERC-20 SRK (Ethereum) to Binance Smart Chain as BEP-20 SRKb token

  - SparkSwap AMM Exchange. An early preview of our automated market maker decentralized exchange.



  SRK is the native utility token that is used for:


  - Payment for SparkLearn courses

  - Prizes in SparkPlay tournaments and achievements

  - Payment for SparkPlay game NFTs

  - Rewards for completing bounties in SparkEarn

  - Rewards for Liquidity Providers and Stakers

  - Payment for SparkPoint IT-BPO services



  How Many SRK Tokens Are There in Circulation?


  The SRK token was launched on the Ethereum mainnet on March 14, 2019 with an initial total supply of
  20 billion SRK tokens. A series of token burns have reduced the total supply down to 14,368,540,937
  SRK tokens. Quarterly token burns are scheduled in the future to reduce the total supply to its final
  fixed maximum value of 10 billion SRK tokens. There are currently 6,486,932,911 SRK tokens in circulation.


  Of the initial total supply, 20% of the tokens were distributed to private sale participants. A minimal
  amount was allocated for sale to avoid any sudden fall in the price of SRK in the market. 7% of the
  tokens were allocated for marketing and airdrops, and 10% for community development programs. Majority
  of the tokens were allocated for SparkPoint Ecosystem Development at 38%. Most of the tokens that were
  burned were also part of this allocation. As for the rest of the tokens, 10% were allocated for the
  Founders, 5% for the current team, another 5% for future team members, and the remaining 5% for advisors.

  the tech industry for more than 16 years and is one of the pioneers in the Philippine tech startup industry.
