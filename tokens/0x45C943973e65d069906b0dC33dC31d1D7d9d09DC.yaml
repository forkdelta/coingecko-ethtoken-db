description: >-
  The CINEMADROM is the first company to create a complex ecosystem based on Blockchain Technology for
  the new World Cinema - 3.0. For this we use advanced technologies (DeFiMovie and NFTMovie) that allow
  us to decentralize as much as possible, reduce the cost and simplify the process of financing, film
  production and distribution.


  MOVIECASH (MVH) this is a crypto-asset CINEMADROM intended for the financing of Movie Projects, trading
  on cryptocurrency exchanges, and support for (DeFiMovie and NFTMovie) services of the ecosystem CINEMADROM.
  Blockchain-based MVH is analogous to the Property Exclusive Copyright for Movie.


  MVH is also a control token in the DefiMovie protocol. Users who have the MVH token can make changes
  to DefiMovie and vote on protocol improvements.
