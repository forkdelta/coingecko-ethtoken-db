description: >-
  It is a DeFi uncollateralized lending protocol developed by the TrustToken team. Lenders can borrow
  cryptocurrencies with predictable loan rates without the need to pledge collaterals like Aave, Compound,
  and Venus. In the long term, TrueFi aims to become a market-driven, automated credit rating and lending
  system. This will demand building beyond the rigid, conservative constraints such as minimum/maximum
  APY and high TRU participation factor. It will also require increased levels of responsibility from
  users, especially for onboarding new borrowers beyond the pre-approved whitelist and approving new loan
  types.
