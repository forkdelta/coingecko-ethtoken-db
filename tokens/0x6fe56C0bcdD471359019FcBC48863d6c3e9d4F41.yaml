  The Props Project is intended to empower the people who help digital communities thrive, and create
  better alignment between app developers and their users. Props’ open-source infrastructure creates a
  decentralized network of apps operated by independent developers, who share an underlying token, benefiting
  from collective network effects. Props abstracts blockchain’s technological and regulatory complexity
  for apps, enabling them to easily plug Props Tokens into any app in the network, in order to grant their
  users unique benefits and a financial stake in the very networks they help grow. Props is backed by
  Union Square Ventures, Venrock, Comcast Ventures, Zeev Ventures, and others.
