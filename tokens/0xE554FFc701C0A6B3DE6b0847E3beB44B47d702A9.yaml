  Based on blockchain technology, ITOChain is committed to building a secure, transparent and trustworthy
  social platform for intelligent replication transactions. ITOChain is not a platform for foreign exchange
  brokers, but a replication trading service for investors, linking brokers, followers, and traders. In
  addition, ITOChain is not a traditional replication trading platform. It is suitable for decentralized
  blockchain technology. It is different from the server-client mode widely used in traditional platforms
  to get rid of the common reliability trap in single-center services. Blockchain is a decentralized and
  immutable data storage technology, which has the characteristics of distribution and chain. Its core
  value is to create a secure and reliable system that enables any non-trusted organization or individual
  to interact with information and data without any authorized central organization arrangements.
