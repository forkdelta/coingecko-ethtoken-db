  The 2016 economic report “On the Value of Virtual Currencies” commissioned by the Bank of Canada, found
  three contributing components dictating a cryptocurrency’s exchange rate:


  The actual use of virtual currency to execute real payments.

  The decision of forward-looking investors to buy virtual currency (thereby effectively regulating its
  supply).

  The elements that jointly drive future consumer adoption and merchant acceptance of virtual currency.

  XAC Attention Addresses

  Attention Addresses are linked to AMARK consumer data and have specific rules enforced by the XAC protocol.
  There are two key functions of attention addresses:


  XAC-LOCK

  XAC-Lock is a feature that encourages continued consumer engagement with AMARK. The XAC sent to Attention
  Addresses is initially locked and becomes available after a maturation period. The XAC attention awards
  paid to consumers continually matures into availability as new XAC is earned from ongoing attention
  marketing. This process encourages engagement with AMARK as attention wallets will rarely have a zero
  XAC balance, giving consumers a consistent flow of value to spend within the ecosystem.


  XAC-BURN

  XAC-Burn is enforced at the protocol level. All transfers to Attention Addresses require 5% of the XAC
  transferred to be burned. The XAC -Burn feature is designed to align interests between merchants and
  consumers in the AMARK ecosystem. Anytime merchants use the AMARK platform for marketing, they are supporting
  the value of the XAC currency as protocol rules enforces a 5% burn. As such, merchants are effectively
  scaling the supply of XAC to match the demand from the ecosystem. This supply-side scaling mechanism
  will offset new coins introduced through block rewards and pressure the price of XAC to an equilibrium
  reflective of demand from the ecosystem.
