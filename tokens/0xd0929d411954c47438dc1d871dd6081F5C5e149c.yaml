  Refereum uses the blockchain to directly connect developers and influencers, resulting in lower marketing
  costs and increased profits for everyone. In addition to more effective growth, Refereum strengthens
  engagement by offering cash prizes â€” enabling rewards for anything from an in-game high score to an
  eSports grand prize. We are working closely with Twitch and Unity, and anyone can play our open source
  demo today.
