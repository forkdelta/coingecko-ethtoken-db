  Along with the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the blockchain technology has developed rapidly in recent
  years. In some countries, blockchain technology was mooted as one of the frontier technologies within
  the National Strategic Layout.Blockchain technology is going to provide the fundamental infrastructure
  for the next generation of Internet – the Internet of Value, and is now collaborating with emerging
  technologies in different fields to progressively expand the application range.As we know, IoT network
  is seen as an extension of the Internet, so it is inevitable that IoT will eventually be merged with
  blockchain. Especially considering the security issues involved with massive amounts of data potentially
  being collected by IoT devices in the future. KingXChain aims to solve a wide range of the current problems
  of IoT networks in terms of data security, data circulation, data sharing and data transactions, thus
  enhancing the efficiency of the whole IoT ecosystem. KingXChain introduces the concept of “lastic sharding
  at layer one” which facilitates the integration of IoT devices with the KingXChain blockchain network.
