This is lowest in comparison across other defi projects like Sushi\n- Best part 50% of the dev funds are used for buying bns on a periodic basis\n- Contract is super clean as there is no mint function there except for the block rewards which are happening every block. So there is no risk associated with it. No time lock needed as only BNSChef can mint rewards and those rewards are specific to block\"","developer_score":16.765,"id":"bnsd-finance","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12368/large/bnsd.png?1599358388","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12368/small/bnsd.png?1599358388","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12368/thumb/bnsd.png?1599358388"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x668DbF100635f593A3847c0bDaF21f0a09380188","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x668dbf100635f593a3847c0bdaf21f0a09380188"],"chat_url":["https://discord.gg/SNdKna"],"homepage":["https://bns.finance/"],"official_forum_url":["https://medium.com/bitbns"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/bitbns-official/bns-defi"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitbns/","telegram_channel_identifier":"Bitbns","twitter_screen_name":"bitbns"},"liquidity_score":41.702,"market_cap_rank":619,"name":"BNSD Finance","public_interest_score":0.0,"symbol":"bnsd","tickers":[]}
