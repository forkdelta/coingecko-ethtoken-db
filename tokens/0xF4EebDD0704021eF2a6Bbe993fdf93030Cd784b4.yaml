description: >-
  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse EOS (EOS) through price feeds supplied by an oracle.


  The entry point is $2.22 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth freezes when
  it reaches its upper limit of $3.33 (i.e. when Inverse EOS's value reaches $1.11) or its lower limit
  of $1.11 (i.e. when Inverse EOS’s value reaches $3.33). If it reaches either of its limits and gets
  frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for
  other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after it has reached either of its limits, it will be
  substituted for another iEOS with different limits.
