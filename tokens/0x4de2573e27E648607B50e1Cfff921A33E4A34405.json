It aims to solve the shortcomings of centralized exchanges by creating a global shared lending pool, and a symbiotic off-chain infrastructure supported by incentivized participants - Relayers and Wranglers. Simply put, Lenders contribute their offers to the lending pool through relayers, who then match the offers with appropriate traders. The traders can use the borrowed funds to margin trade, make a profit, and repay the lenders.","developer_score":29.675,"id":"lendroid-support-token","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3485/large/lendroid-support-token.png?1547975703","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3485/small/lendroid-support-token.png?1547975703","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3485/thumb/lendroid-support-token.png?1547975703"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x4de2573e27e648607b50e1cfff921a33e4a34405"],"homepage":["https://www.lendroid.com/"],"official_forum_url":["https://blog.lendroid.com/"],"repos_url":{"github":["https://github.com/lendroidproject/tge-contracts"]},"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/lendroidproject/","telegram_channel_identifier":"lendroidproject","twitter_screen_name":"lendroidproject"},"liquidity_score":1.0,"market_cap_rank":2366,"name":"Lendroid Support Token","public_interest_score":27.697,"symbol":"lst","tickers":[]}
