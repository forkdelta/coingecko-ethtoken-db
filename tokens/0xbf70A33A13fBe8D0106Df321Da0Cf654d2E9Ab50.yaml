description: >-
  The ETH/BTC RSI Ratio Trading Set attempts to capitalize on longer term trends by detecting the speed
  and change of price movements in the ETH/BTC ratio while staying fully exposed to crypto. ETHBTCRSI
  automatically triggers rebalances if the Relative Strength Index (RSI) crosses below support or above
  resistance to indicate the price momentum.
