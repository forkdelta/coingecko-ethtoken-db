  The world's first self-destructing currency.


  BOMB is a social experiment and financial case study to measure the feasibility of a deflationary currency. 
  The rules are simple.


  1) There were originally 1,000,000 Bomb in existence.


  2) Each time a Bomb is transferred, 1% of the transaction is destroyed.


  3) There will never be newly minted Bomb.


  The intention is not to be used as a transactional currency, but rather a consistent and decentralized
  store of value. Through a system of immutable smart contracts and continuous hyperdeflation, BOMB is
  the world’s first self-destructing currency.
