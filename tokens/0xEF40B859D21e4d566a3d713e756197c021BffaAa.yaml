  APENFT Fund was born with the mission to register world-class artworks as NFTs on-chain. It is built
  on top of TRON, one of the world's top three public chains, and is powered by the world's largest distributed
  data storage system BitTorrent.


  Like how blockchain democratizes finance like never before, APENFT, by turning top artists and art pieces
  into NFTs, not only upgrades the way artworks are hosted but also transforms them from being elite-exclusive
  items to something that truly belongs to the people and mirrors their aspirations. APENFT is the art
  for everyone.
