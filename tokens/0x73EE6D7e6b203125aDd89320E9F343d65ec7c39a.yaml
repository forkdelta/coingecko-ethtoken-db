  Axioms. Kickstart your crypto.


  Community as a Service

  Axioms doesn’t just create your token: it promotes it to a readymade community that’s willing to support
  your project.



  1. Take a great idea

  Create your own token and build a supportive community with the whole process, from coding to deployment,
  fully automated.



  2. Tokenize it

  Farm it. Stake it. Tip it. Earn it. You choose the utility. We’ll program it.



  3. Add Axioms

  The AXIOMS token powers the Axioms network, providing utility for an incentivized community.
