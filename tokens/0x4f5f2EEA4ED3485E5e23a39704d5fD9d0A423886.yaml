description: >-
  The hacker interstellar application uses Tor to encrypt through the application layer of the 5-tier
  protocol stack, thus realizing the technology of cracking blocks. Tor will crack data including blocks
  of the next node several times and submit it it through virtual algorithm. Each time, a layer of encrypted
  blocks is decrypted to know the degree of cracking, and the remaining number of cracks is sent back
  to Tor. The final relay decrypts the innermost encrypted data and, without leaking or knowing the source
  IP address, the reward for cracking the block occurs to the user.
