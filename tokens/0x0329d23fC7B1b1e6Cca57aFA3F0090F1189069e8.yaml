description: >-
  The LINK RSI Crossover Set attempts to capitalize on trends by detecting the speed and change of price
  movements to accumulate more LINK. LINKRSI5545 automatically triggers rebalances if the RSI crosses
  below support or above resistance to indicate the price momentum. If the LINK RSI falls below support
  at 45 in an existing uptrend, LINKRSI5545 rebalances LINK into cash (USDC). If the LINK RSI breaks above
  resistance at 55 in an existing downtrend, LINKRSI5545 rebalances back into LINK.
