  WHAT IS ADVENTURE TOKEN?

  TWA Adventure Token is a deflationary community token.


  Every time Adventure Token is purchased, sold or transferred between wallets one percent of the total
  transaction value is burnt, meaning that with every trade Adventure Token becomes scarcer. Trading attracts
  liquidity, which in-turn attracts further trading. Liquidity grows and the supply of Adventure Token
  decreases with every trade.


  Holding Adventure Token also gives you the opportunity to earn further rewards in the Adventure Luna
  Fund.
