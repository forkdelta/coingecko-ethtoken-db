One of the important components of the project is a digital DNA storage or electronic Biobank.\n\nThe name of the CTAGtoken token is an abbreviation of 4 types of nitrogenous bases that form DNA chains (Cytosine, Thymine, Adenine, Guanine). S.Genomics created CTAGtoken as a unit of a calculation inside an ecosystem.\n\nYou can use CTAGtoken for purchase DNA tests and get your health passport; get a cell to store your genomic data in a Biobank; use to pay for the lease of the computing power of neural network for research purposes.","developer_score":0.0,"id":"ctagtoken","image":{"large":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8374/large/Group-42.147.png?1557815469","small":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8374/small/Group-42.147.png?1557815469","thumb":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/8374/thumb/Group-42.147.png?1557815469"},"links":{"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xb0f14f66cae71164d89e8a0cf0875ef2c32fb660"],"homepage":["http://ctagtoken.com/"]},"liquidity_score":23.046,"market_cap_rank":4525,"name":"CTAGtoken","public_interest_score":26.139,"symbol":"ctag","tickers":[{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"coinsbit","name":"Coinsbit"},"target":"USD"},{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"BTC"},{"base":"CTAG","market":{"identifier":"p2pb2b","name":"P2PB2B"},"target":"ETH"}]}
