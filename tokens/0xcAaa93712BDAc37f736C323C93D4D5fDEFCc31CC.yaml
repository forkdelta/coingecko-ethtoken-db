description: "The CRD network is taking a multipronged approach to building out its network and enabling\
  \ Cryptocurrency and Defi adoption.\n\nOn the one hand, we are building out our new hybrid crypto-banking\
  \ and staking platform, with advanced fully regulated banking features connected to the legacy banking\
  \ ecosystem with everything you would expect from a traditional banking point of view, i.e. with online\
  \ banking, debit cards, banking app, cashback, rewards, discounts etc\n\nAt the same time, we are also\
  \ enabling seamless access via your account to all the best that the world of cryptocurrency markets\
  \ has to offer i.e.: fiat to crypto exchange, decentralized markets, defi, staking, yield farming, (not\
  \ to mention, tokenised shares, on-chain derivatives markets, NFT's etc) \n\nOn the other hand, we are\
  \ also delivering infrastructure and accelerator programs to influencers, developers, fintech builders,\
  \ to enable them to build out products and communities.\n\nBy empowering developers, builders and influencers,\
  \ with the tools, incentives, community and framework to fund, develop and build out futureproof products,\
  \ paired with ready to go crypto communities, we are not only simultaneously growing the CRD network\
  \ on an infrastructure and community level, but also helping educate, and to accelerate the broader\
  \ adoption of these technologies.\n\nThe CRD Network uses its own token, known as CRD, which gives access\
  \ to the network and fuels all transactions within the network, including fees, and governance/staking.\
  \ \n\n\nTechnology Infrastructure \n\nThe CRD Network smoothens interoperability between the worlds\
  \ of centralized finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). It runs on Hyperledger Besu, an enterprise\
  \ blockchain on Ethereum, and uses CRD Nodes and APIs to operate. This infrastructure enables third-party\
  \ developers to build a wide variety of fintech applications on top of it.\n\n\nFor further details\
