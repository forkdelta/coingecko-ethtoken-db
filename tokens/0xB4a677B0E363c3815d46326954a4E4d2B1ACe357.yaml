  The Node improves the problems of existing mining methods by combining Ethereum chain and Master Node
  chain via THENODE DUAL CORE. Coins mined through node operation can be used in incubating investments
  and own Dapps,

  and the amount of circulation increased due to mining is controlled by market logic by burning of used
  coins via incubating investments.
