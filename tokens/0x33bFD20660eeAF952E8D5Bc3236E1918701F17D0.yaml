description: >-
  The RCCC platform is based on EOS development and was originally designed to allow art lovers and industry
  participants to exchange information conveniently and safely and reliably. Because blockchain technology
  is open and transparent, and data cannot be tampered with, all historical information of a work of art
  can be retrieved at any stage to verify its provenance and ownership. The RCCC expert appraisal network
  can review through visual inspection when necessary and ensure the quality of the artwork. The RCCC
  will promote the establishment of a fully transparent art market for the arts and attract more art investors.
