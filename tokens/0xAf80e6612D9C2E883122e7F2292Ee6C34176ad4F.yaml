description: >-
  CoinJanitor offers a recycling mechanism to restore the lost value in functionally dead coins and reduce
  cryptocurrency market dilution. Holders, community members and creators of failed coins are provided
  a way to join a project that has the network effect that the projects they created or supported failed
  to achieve, and implementing a subsequent systematic burn of the coins bought out.
