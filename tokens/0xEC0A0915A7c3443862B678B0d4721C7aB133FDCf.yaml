  Wrapped Origin Axie Token (WOA) is a token that allows users to wrap Origin Axies and trade them like
  an erc-20 token. You can only wrap Origin Axies from a common class (beast, plant, aquatic). In addition
  the Axie cannot contain any mystic parts and canâ€™t have been bred more than 2 times. These limitations
  ensure that the Origin Axies within the pool are all of similar value.


  WOA can be burnt to redeem a random Origin inside the WOA token pool.
