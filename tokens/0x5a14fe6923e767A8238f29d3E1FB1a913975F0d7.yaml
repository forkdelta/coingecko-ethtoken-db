  Playway â€“ one of the biggest game producer in Poland, listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange has launched the
  first platform that uses blockchain technology for acquiring ideas for new video games. Thanks to the
  newly launched Need for Game Idea platform (available at www.pway.io), Playway wants to acquire ideas
  for new titles from game players around the world. Its will be produced by development studios that
  are part of the PlayWay Group, which consists of over 200 development teams concentrated in 120 companies.
  Idea makers will be rewarded in PWAY tokens, digital tokens, based on Ethereum blockchain.

  The platform will also play one more important function - it will integrate and activate the multi-million
  Playway games fans around the world, enabling the purchase (exclusively for PWAYs) of unique products
  and services related to the games of the PlayWay Group and the impact on the development of the platform.

  After registering on the platform, using their Steam account, users will be able to submit their ideas
  for games. Each user will be able to submit only one idea for which he will receive 1 PWAY token. The
  authors of the best game ideas will be invited to further work on the concept of the game. They, after
  concluding an agreement transferring the copyright to the concept, will receive immediately 100 PWAYs,
  as well as a 5% share in the profits from the sale of the game based on the submitted concept, if it
  is finally implemented and released.

  Unlike many ICO projects, the company will not raise funds from the market. The company's goal is to
  get interesting game ideas from players. The only source of the supply of PWAY tokens will be the authors
  of the game ideas (1 and 100 tokens) and the few developers of the platform. Profits from the games
  (5%) will be paid in PWAY tokens, which the company will buy from the market (crypto exchanges) and
  send to the authors of game ideas.
