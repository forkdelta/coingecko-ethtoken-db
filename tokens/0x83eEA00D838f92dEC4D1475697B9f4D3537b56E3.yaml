  The VOISE ecosystem, built using Ethereum protocol is a highly secure and transparent music and digital
  content distribution and streaming platform with one-of-a-kind model that shares 100% of sale proceeds
  with the artist – charging zero commission or processing fees. At the same time, the platform also ensures
  the benefits are passed on to the users in the form of reduced prices.

  Many believe that blockchain platforms and cryptocurrencies are complex technological creations which
  are not easy to use. They believe that for someone to be able to understand the technology and use any
  such platform should have advanced technical skills.


  VOISE addresses these apprehensions by providing an easy to use interface and support for multiple cryptocurrencies
  as well as fiat to make it as good as any other conventional music streaming service out there in today’s
  market. The team behind VOISE have conducted extensive research into the industry to identify the problems.
  They are implementing these learnings to develop a platform that can address most of the issues. The
  VOISE ecosystem is powered by its own VOISE ERC20 tokens, which acts as

  the primary mode of transaction on the platform.


  The main objective of VOISE team is to create a platform that can serve the purposes of both the artists
  and users. The platform built over Ethereum protocol makes use of smart contracts for automation and
  provides an easy and cost-effective way to sell and stream music. Unlike other similar platforms, VOISE
  incorporates a simple yet efficient user interface that allows the users to browse and listen to music
  just the way they have been doing on conventional music platform. The multi cryptocurrency and fiat
  support makes the platform even more convenient for the users.


  VOISE is one of the successful cryptocurrency projects of 2017. The platform has introduced blockchain
  technology into the music industry to encourage the growth of the ecosystem while solving some of the
  issues regarding the well-being of the artist community. At the same time, the VOISE team has also made
  it their mission to promote the use of cryptocurrencies among the general public. In order to familiarize
  people with cryptocurrency usage, they have included support for various payment options alongside the
  platform’s native VOISE tokens. Even though VOISE tokens remain the primary mode of value exchange on
  the platform, people can still purchase music using other cryptocurrencies and even fiat. By including
  fiat payments, VOISE is ensuring that those who are not used to conducting cryptocurrency transactions
  aren’t left out and at the same time, it also acts as a gateway for them to enter the blockchain and
  digital currency domain.
