description: >-
  The ETH High Volatility Set is for you if you believe the price of Ether will swing within a large range
  in the medium to long term. This Set automatically rebalances cash (DAI) into ETH if the price of ETH
  dips more than 50% and ETH into cash (DAI) if the price of ETH rebounds more than 40%. The token tolerances
  are selected to balance profit against risk, preventing token holders from selling into a rally (or
  buying into a drop) yet still taking profits when the downside of missing a trade is too high.
