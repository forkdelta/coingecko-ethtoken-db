description: >-
  BasisCoin is an open-source, permisionless, highly- scalable, decentralized, algorithmic protocol built
  on Ethereum.

  This is a protocol inspired by Basis.cash. We found some design flaws in Basis.cash and made improvements.
  But retain the underlying structure of Basis.cash, because we believe that a structure that has been
  tested by time and users is stable and safe.
