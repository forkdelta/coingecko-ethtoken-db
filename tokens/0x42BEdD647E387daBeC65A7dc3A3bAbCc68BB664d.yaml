  Blockmason is excited to announce the creation of our second blockchain industry revolutionizing product:
  Blockmason Link!


  At its core, Link removes the barriers to interact with smart contracts, allowing developers to instantly
  turn smart contracts on any programmatic blockchain into user-friendly applications. We’ll use Ethereum
  smart contracts as the example throughout this whitepaper, but Link is main-chain agnostic and is architected
  in a manner that is adaptable to the leading smart contract supporting main-chains without a native
  Web API layer.


  Link solves some of the most persistent and pervasive problems plaguing the blockchain community: ease-of-use
  and accessibility. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in the public consciousness, blockchain still
  primarily functions as a vehicle for cryptocurrency trading and other financial applications.


  At Blockmason, we are true blockchain believers — it is only a matter of time until blockchain spurs
  the healthcare revolution, empowers economic freedom in developing countries, and stabilizes our fragile
  mass payment systems. However, it is impossible to realize this beautiful crypto-future until the completion
  of essential components of blockchain infrastructure.


  Blockchain has a high barrier to entry. From a development perspective, it requires learning Solidity,
  cryptography APIs, and the nuances of esoteric decentralized systems. From a user perspective, the hesitation
  is even simpler: decentralized applications are too damn tough to use! In a world that increasingly
  values convenience, it’s difficult to convince people to increase their DApp usage when usage necessitates
  so many prerequisites, including creating and learning to use an Ethereum wallet, MetaMask, safely storing
  your private keys, and so on. Just try explaining to someone the long-term benefits of decentralized
  contracts when even those in charge of regulating new technologies have no idea how they work. All the
  public thinks is: why use a “smart contract,” when dumb contracts work just fine? Why use Lndr, when
  I could use Venmo?


  Which brings us to one of Blockmason’s core beliefs: for an emerging technology to succeed, it must
  value the user. For too long, the blockchain community has ignored functionality, in favor of niche
  technical development, finance, or profit — hindering mass adoption. This is not to say we don’t love
  nerdy, precise technical advancement (we do!), but rather that we believe a smooth, exciting user experience
  is a necessary part of technological growth.


  Fully realizing the potential of blockchain technology requires the mass adoption of blockchain technology.
  Mass adoption requires an enhanced user experience, which itself requires technological innovation.
  Conversely, any technical breakthrough, regardless of its importance, is squandered if it does not solve
  the user experience. Greater access to technology leads to greater technological advancement. Just think
  of us as blockchain’s “Typhoid Mary.”


  Blockmason Link — the missing block in blockchain’s ever growing tower. An innovation that sparks innovation.
