  Smaller E&P companies have limited access to equity markets and bank financing, yet they can still offer
  plenty of opportunity for return. That is why Silver Wave Energy is launching the SWE token. By launching
  its own token sale, an E&P company like Silver Wave Energy can finance a thorough exploration phase
  that fosters a profitable production phase.


  For token holders, the SWE token offers access to a private oil investment opportunity in South Africa
  that has been vetted by geological experts. It is estimated that this venture could produce 40,000 barrels
  of crude oil per day in the production phase. Once operations become profitable, which is expected in
  2024. Individual crypto holders can therefore participate in the returns from this promising energy
  venture thanks to the SWE token.
