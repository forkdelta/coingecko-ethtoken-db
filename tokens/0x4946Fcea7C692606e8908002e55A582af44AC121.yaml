  FOAM is an open protocol for proof of location on Ethereum. Our mission is to build a consensus driven
  map of the world, empowering a fully decentralized web3 economy with verifiable location data. FOAM
  incentivizes the infrastructure needed for privacy-preserving and fraud-proof location verification.
  The starting point for FOAM is static proof of location, where a community of Cartographers curate geographic
  Points of Interest on the FOAM map. Through global community-driven efforts, FOAM’s dynamic proof of
  location protocol will enable a permissionless and privacy-preserving network of radio beacons that
  is independent from external centralized sources and capable of providing secure location verification
  services.


  FOAM Token Functionality

  1. Add and Curate Geographic Points of Interest

  The FOAM Spatial Index Visualizer allows Cartographers to participate in interactive TCR POIs on a map.
  Users can add points to the map, validate new candidates and verify the map by visiting real world locations.
  The FOAM Token Curated Registry unlocks mapping in a secure and permissionless fashion and allows locations
  to be ranked and maintained by token balances. Users can deposit FOAM Tokens into POIs on the map to
  increase attention those POIs might receive.


  2. Signal for Zone Incentivisation

  A further potential use of the FOAM Token by Cartographers is to stake their FOAM Tokens to Signal.
  Signaling is a mechanism designed to allow Cartographers to incentivize the expansion and geographic
  coverage of the FOAM network. To Signal, a Cartographer stakes FOAM Tokens to a Signaling smart contract
  by reference to a particular area. These staked tokens serve as indicators of demand, and are proportionate
  to (i) the length of time staking (the earlier, the better), and (ii) the number of tokens staked (the
  less well-served areas, the better). In the context of the contingent Dynamic Proof of Location concept
  (described further in the Product Whitepaper), these indicators are the weighted references that determine
  the spatial mining rewards.


  3. Contribute to Potential Secure Location Services as Zone Anchor or Verifier

  The FOAM protocol may allow users to provide work and secure localization services and location verification
  for smart contracts and be rewarded for their own efforts with new FOAM Tokens in the form of mining
  rewards. Devices and real world contracts can be programmed to designate attestations and track interactions
  and transactions on the map. With the addition of necessary radio hardware by individual users and the
  grass roots expansion of the FOAM network, it may be possible for location status to be proved in a
  different manner. Location could be proved through a time synchronization protocol that would ensure
  continuity of a distributed clock, whereby specialized hardware could synchronize nodes’ clocks over
  radio to provide location services in a given area. As explained further in the following paragraph,
  this ‘Dynamic Proof of Location’ is contingent on a number of factors outside of Foamspace’s control.
