description: >-
  "I do not believe in one single strategy for executing trades. Markets are places where information
  converges into a single bit of information: price. My trading strategy centers around balancing the
  main components of what makes up a price in the crypto space:


  - Short-term news cycles

  - Recent price action

  - Historical price action


  Because I am very tapped in"" to the pulse of crypto, and Ethereum especially, this gives me an informational
  advantage over my position and trades. While the information is available to everyone, I think I am
  uniquely positioned to interpret and digest information in ways that others do not."
