description: >-
  A token only becomes a currency once it is used by markets as a store of value and means of exchange.
  To date, no blockchain-based contender has achieved this goal. Adoption as currency is contingent upon
  the fulfillment of several conditions, chiefly: tamed volatility; regulatory oversight and efficient
  governance. Saga addresses all of these in its proposition for a new, global currency - SGA.
