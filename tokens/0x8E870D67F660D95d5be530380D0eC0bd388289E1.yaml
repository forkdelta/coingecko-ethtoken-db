  Paxos Standard (PAX) was created by Paxos, a financial technology company on a mission to modernize
  finance by mobilizing assets at the speed of the internet. Paxos was the first virtual currency company
  to receive a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services. As a chartered limited
  purpose trust company with fiduciary powers under the Banking Law, Paxos is able to offer regulated
  services in the crypto-asset and virtual commodities space.


  The Paxos team comes from a wide variety of backgrounds with a diverse array of experiences ranging
  from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. It’s led by CEO and co-founder Charles Cascarilla, who has spent
  his career as a customer, analyst, investor and now creator of financial technology.


  Paxos describes itself as “the first regulated Trust company with blockchain expertise”, and it is using
  that expertise to create a modern settlement solution that can eliminate risk and simplify settlements.
  What many people may not know about Paxos is that it was actually founded in 2012 as Paxos Trust Company,
  and that for most of its life it ran the cryptocurrency exchange itBit, which is still operates. The
  creation of Paxos was a pivot from an exchange platform to a company focused on creating a modern settlement
  platform using blockchain technology.


  Paxos has become the most widely adopted cryptocurrency in the fastest time frame, with support from
  over 20 exchanges and OTC desks in the first five weeks of its existence. It’s been picked up and listed
  by six of the top ten cryptocurrency exchanges, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/binance">Binance</a>,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/okex">OKEx</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/gate">Gate.io</a>,
  <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/zb">ZB</a>, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/kucoin">KuCoin</a>
  and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/digifinex">DigiFinex</a>. These exchanges are offering
  PAX as an alternative to the controversial <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether">Tether</a>.
  Unlike the controversy surrounding the people who control Tether, there is no such obscurity when it
  comes to the people behind Paxos. The CEO and co-founder is Charles Cascarilla. He has over 15 years
  in financial services and has co-founded Cedar Hill asset management back in 2005. He has also worked
  and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs prior to that.


  The Paxos Standard (PAX) is the first digital asset to be issued by a financial institution and to be
  fully secured by the U.S. dollar. While other similar stablecoins have existed, there has been no proof
  of full U.S. dollar reserves, nor have these earlier assets been issued by a financial institution.
  The Paxos team has been fairly clear in declaring the different base that PAX is working from.
