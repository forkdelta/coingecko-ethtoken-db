  The Tratok token is a unique token which will be used on the Tratok Travel application to make bookings
  for travel and tourism services. Be it reserving a hotel room, booking a flight or renting a car, this
  multiplatform application will result in more economical, hassle-free arrangements for clients and service
  providers alike. By using blockchain technology to disrupt the existing business model, Tratok offers
  significant advantages over existing conventional platforms. Principally, it lowers transaction fees,
  eradicates the need for middlemen, saves time on bookings and results in more profit for service providers
  and savings for consumers. With stakeholder experience as the main priority, the Tratok project seeks
  to revolutionise the USD 7.6 Trillion travel and tourism sector and set a new standard.
