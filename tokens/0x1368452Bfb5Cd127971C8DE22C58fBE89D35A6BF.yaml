description: >-
  NTR/e is a wholly decentralized bridge token created to provide liquidity and increased access to the
  Jointer syndication ecosystem and the primary JNTR token. Due to JNTR/e being decentralized, it has
  the ability to list on decentralized exchanges and participate in decentralized finance pools and swaps
  like Uniswap.

  Jointer minted a total of 1,000,000 JNTR/e on the Ethereum blockchain, with 0% accessible to the team,
  founders, and investors.

  Jointer will burn 100% of the relay token (the LP share that controls the pool) which will alimt Jointer
  to ever access that pool or change it.

  Jointer will distribute more than 63% of the total JNTR/e minted or 630 JNTR/e to the top holders of
  Uniswap.
