  DWS is a decentralized WI-FI sharing ecosystem secured and incentivized through blockchain technology.
  DWS’s mission is to create a decentralized Wi-Fi sharing network using secure blockchain technology,
  making wireless internet accessible around the globe with the help of a worldwide community. By making
  Wi-Fi tradable, DWS allows for more effective advertising for advertisers, provides full internet connectivity
  everywhere, and rewards users who share their Wi-Fi network.


  All business models on the DWS ecosystem are carried out through DWS tokens, a utility token based on
  the value of data usage, and smart contracts, which automatically execute all exchanges of services.
  The DWS protocol will establish infrastructure to measure the precise amount of data, not only based
  on amount of time, but by actual data consumption. The end result is a transparent sharing economy between
  users, Wi-Fi owners, and advertisers.

  DWS是一个去中心化的Wi-Fi共享生态系统，通过区块链技术得到激励和安全保障。DWS于2018年在新加坡成立，其使命是利用安全的区块链技术创建一个去中心化的Wi-Fi共享网络，通过全球社区的帮助在全球范围内提供无线互联网。
  DWS生态系统上的所有商业模式都是通过DWS通证执行的。这些DWS通证是基于数据使用价值的实用通证和智能合约，可自动执行所有服务交换。 DWS协议将建立基础架构来测量精确的数据量，不仅基于时间，而且还基于实际的数据消耗量。最终DWS将建立一个用户、Wi-Fi所有者和广告商之间透明的共享经济。
