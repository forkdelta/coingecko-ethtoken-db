description: >-
  $STONK is an indicator for DeFi. $STONK's value is derived from a balancer pool of DeFi's class leading
  protocol-layer contracts, consisting of COMP, LINK , KNC, ETH, SNX, REP, LRC. By investing in $STONK,
  you are investing in an index fund of DeFi's leading projects. Value in $STONK and value in the pool
  directly benefits all DeFi projects involved.


  The deflationary nature of $STONK combined with the balancer pool creates a constant cycle of trading
  opportunities. This occurs while massive price movements such as swing trading & whale dumping are dampened
  - especially made prevalent by $STONK's 42% share in the pool.
