description: >-
  Myōbu was designed to reward holders and discourage dumping. Learning from the mistakes of past so-called
  "anti-whale" tokens with fixed transaction and wallet limits that become useless as the number of pooled
  tokens decrease over time, we have introduced a dynamic sell limit that's based on price impact. Each
  sell is limited to 2,9% price impact to prevent whale dumps. Only 4 sells with increasing sell cooldowns
  and taxation rates on consecutive sells are allowed within a 24 hours period to prevent serial dumping.
