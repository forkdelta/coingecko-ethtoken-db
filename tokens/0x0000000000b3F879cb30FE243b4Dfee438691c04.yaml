  GasToken is a new, cutting-edge Ethereum contract that allows users to tokenize gas on the Ethereum
  network, storing gas when it is cheap and using / deploying this gas when it is expensive. Using GasToken
  can subsidize high gas prices on transactions to do everything from arbitraging decentralized exchanges
  to buying into ICOs early. GasToken is also the first contract on the Ethereum network that allows users
  to buy and sell gas directly, enabling long-term "banking" of gas that can help shield users from rising
  gas prices.


  Gas is a fundamental resource in the Ethereum network. Every transaction on the network must include
  some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed
  by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas,
  saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly
  higher fees. Using GasToken on an eligible transaction, you can save money on the Ethereum network today.


  Gas prices on Ethereum are hard to predict; they can be as cheap as 1 gwei or less at off-peak hours,
  while some transactions pay into the hundreds of gwei to buy into that juicy ICO or hit an order on
  EtherDelta before any other players. Users who need to be mined quickly or first often engage in fierce
  bidding wars, bidding wars in which using GasToken provides an enormous advantage by letting you perform
  the same transactions while spending less gas.


  Compounding this effect, Ethereum blocks are starting to fill up, making block space ever more coveted.
