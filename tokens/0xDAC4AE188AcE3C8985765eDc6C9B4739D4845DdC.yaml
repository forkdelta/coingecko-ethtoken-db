  InterValue aims to solve the problems such as low applicability, transaction congestion, high commissions,
  long con∆ârmation latency, weak resistance to quantum attacks, poor anonymity in communication and transaction,
  incapability in crossing and merging chains, large space for storage and etc. InterValue would optimize
