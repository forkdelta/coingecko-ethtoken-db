  Nucleus Vision, known as nCash was started in 2014. The idea behind the Nucleus Vision platform is to
  make shopping easier by using customerâ€™s records to make precise decisions on product preferences utilizing
  the Internet of Things (IoT) without the use of WiFi or Bluetooth. The technology is being used by ten
  retail stores in India at present and also being backed up by relevant companies in the cryptocurrency
  and goods retail industries.


  For Nucleus Vision, it tends to entirely change the way merchants interact with customers/clients in
  physical stores.The platform also implements a much quicker and faster way of making financial transactions
  for a modern retail experience with the nCash token.
