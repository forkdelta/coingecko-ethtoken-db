  Etymologically, Thal (modern: Tal) is German for "valley", and a thaler is a person or a thing"from
  the valley". The Czech spelling was tolar. any varieties of the term are used in different languages.
  In the 1902 spelling reform, the German spelling was changed from Thal and Thaler to Tal and Taler,
  which however did not affect the English spelling of thaler. The later Dutch daalders also carried the
  picture of a lion, which gave them the name leeuwendaalder ("lion thaler"). From an abbreviation of
  leeuwendaalder come the names of three present-day Balkan currencies, the Romanian and Moldovan Leu
  and the Bulgarian Lev.
