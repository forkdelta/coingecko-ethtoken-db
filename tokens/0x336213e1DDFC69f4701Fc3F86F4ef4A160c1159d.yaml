  Index of: sCEX


  Inversely tracks the price of Inverse Centralised Exchange Index (CEX) through price feeds supplied
  by an oracle. The entry point is $563.2 (the approximate market price at time of creation). This Synth
  freezes when it reaches its upper limit of $844.8 (i.e. when Inverse Centralised Exchange Index's value
  reaches $281.6) or its lower limit of $281.6 (i.e. when Inverse Centralised Exchange Indexâ€™s value reaches
  $844.8). If it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased
  on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value. At some point after
  it has reached either of its limits, it will be substituted for another iCEX with different limits.
